<p>Have I mentioned that my youngest son is an unbearably picky eater?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I have. So I was more than pleasantly surprised when he declared that he LOVED pesto. My wife come home with a tub-full from a local farmer's market and he simply couldn't stop smearing it on bread and gobbling it down. </p>

<p>So I dusted off the food processor and whipped up a batch. I have a feeling I'll be making it fairly often. </p>
