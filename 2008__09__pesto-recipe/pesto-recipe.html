<p>Have I mentioned that my youngest son is an unbearably picky eater?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I have. So I was more than pleasantly surprised when he declared that he LOVED pesto. My wife come home with a tub-full from a local farmer's market and he simply couldn't stop smearing it on bread and gobbling it down. </p>

<p>So I dusted off the food processor and whipped up a batch. I have a feeling I'll be making it fairly often. </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>About 30 fresh Basil Leaves</li>

<li>1/2 Cup Pine Nuts</li>

<li>1/2 Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>

<li>1/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>2-3 Cloves of Garlic</li>

<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1 Tsp fresh ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat a fry pan over medium-high heat. Toast the pine nuts for about five minutes, tossing them often to keep from burning. Remove from heat. </p>

<p>In a large food processor, add the basil, toasted pine nuts, cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper. Pulse a couple times, then slowly drizzle in the olive oil while constantly blending. </p>

<p>Serve over your favorite pasta, or slathered on a piece of crusty bread. </p>
