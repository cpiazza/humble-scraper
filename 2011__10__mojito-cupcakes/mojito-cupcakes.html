<p>This recipe is inspired by my boyfriend's roommate, Jeff.  He regularly drank Mojitos and Pinojitos this summer, because his garden bore an abundance of mint.  Jeff has quite the green thumb and is extremely generous with his vegetable bounty.  It just makes sense to dedicate this delicious, refreshing dessert to him.</p>
<p>The recipe is adapted from two recipes, and requires creating the butter rum sauce while the cupcakes are baking.  When soaking the cupcake, is it important to detach the liner from the cupcake to allow the rum sauce to seep into the bottom of the cakes.    It is helpful to use the Reynolds Stay-Brite foil liners, as the liner detaches easily and retains an elegant shape.  Paper liners are discouraged because they don't retain their shape when loosened, and regular foil tends to rip.  Unfortunately, I was down in Florida when these cupcakes were made, and  Stay-Brite liners were no where to be found.  My mom found the lovely  gold liners in the top picture at Sur La Table. (My mom also decorated the cupcakes above....don't they look great?!)</p>
<p>In the photo below, the Reynolds Stay-Brite liner is on the left, and the regular Reynolds foil on the right.  Notice that the Stay-Brite wrapper almost appears as though it wasn't completely detached from the cupcake!  The monkey patterned liner was love at first sight for this gal.<br>
