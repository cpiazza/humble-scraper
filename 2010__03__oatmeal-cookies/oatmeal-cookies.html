<p><em>me:</em> Raisins or No Raisins?</p>
<p><em>the boys:</em> NO RAISINS!!</p>
<p>And so it was our first homemade batch of <strong>oatmeal cookies</strong> was raisin-less. I did sneak in some whole wheat flour, though...</p>
<p></p>

		
			Ingredients:
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Cup butter, room temperature</li>
<li>1 Cup light brown sugar</li>
<li>1 Cup white sugar</li>
<li>2 Large Eggs</li>
<li>1 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>1 Cup White Flour</li>
<li>1 Cup Whole Wheat Flour</li>
<li>1 Tsp Baking Soda</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 Tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Ground Nutmeg</li>
<li>3 Cups Whole Oats</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In a large bowl, combine the white flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside.</p>
<p>In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, cream the butter and sugars - about 5 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix until well combined. </p>
<p>Add the dry ingredients to the butter / sugar / egg mixture and mix (by hand). Add the oats last and mix in until evenly distributed. </p>
<p>Wrap the cookie dough tightly in saran wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour (over night would be better).</p>
<p>Pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees. On a greased cookie sheet, place golf-sized balls of the dough about 2 inches apart. Flatten with the palm of your hand to about 1/2 inch thick.</p>
<p>Bake 8-11 minutes, until golden. Let cool on a wire rack 5-10 minutes, or until you can't wait any longer. </p>
