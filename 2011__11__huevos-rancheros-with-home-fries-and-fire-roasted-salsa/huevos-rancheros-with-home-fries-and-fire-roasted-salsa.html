<p>Huevos Rancheros is classic Mexican breakfast fare consisting of a fried egg on top of a corn tortilla, covered with salsa.  My parents occasionally ordered this delicious dish when we lived in New Mexico, despite the grease factor.  Traditional Mexican fare has never been known for being healthy.  My mom always looked for ways to lighten up dishes without sacrificing flavor.  This recipe is a tribute to the original, using many of my mom's tricks.</p>
<p>First, instead of fried eggs, use either 2:1 or 3:1 mixture of egg whites to yolks for an omelet.  Whisk the eggs to add air, creating a light and fluffy omelet.  The omelet is also stuffed with sauteed veggies for added taste and texture, and placed on top of a flour tortilla.  Also, good salsa is a must.  I decided to make fresh Fire Roasted Salsa, and was not disappointed.  A lightly sauteed mix of home fries, onions and red peppers provides the perfect accompaniment, and brings the meal together.  This new take on a classic dish will satisfy the taste buds without packing on the pounds.</p>
