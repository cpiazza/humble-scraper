<p>I was thinking about dinner this evening and this one came to me on the train ride home. I've been wanting to experiment with dry rubs for some time now and this evening seemed as good a time as any. I paid a visit to the Grand Central Market before I got on my train and picked up some ancho chili powder and a package of dried guajillo chili peppers. I figured I'd combine them with some of what I had in my pantry and hope for the best. </p>
