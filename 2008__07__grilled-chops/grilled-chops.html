<p>I was thinking about dinner this evening and this one came to me on the train ride home. I've been wanting to experiment with dry rubs for some time now and this evening seemed as good a time as any. I paid a visit to the Grand Central Market before I got on my train and picked up some ancho chili powder and a package of dried guajillo chili peppers. I figured I'd combine them with some of what I had in my pantry and hope for the best. </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 Tbs <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/07/chili-dry-rub.html">Ancho Guajillo Dry Rub</a> </li>

<li>2-3 Double Cut Pork Chops</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove chops from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before grilling. Coat both sides of each chop with generously with dry rub and let stand at room temperature until ready to grill. </p>

<p>Grill over direct-high heat about 3-4 minutes per side, or until a good dark crust forms. After both sides are seared, move chops to the side of the grill (indirect heat) and continue to cook, with grill covered, another 10-12 minutes (depending on thickness). </p>

<p>Remove from grill and let chops stand 5-10 minutes before cutting into them. </p>
