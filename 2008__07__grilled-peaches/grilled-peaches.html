<p>It really doesn't get any simpler than this. I made these to accompany some <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/07/grilled-chops.html">grilled dry rub pork chops</a> and the sweetness was a nice complement to the spicy chili-based rub. </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PeachesÂ  (as many as you like, 1 peach per person works well)</li>

<li>Olive Oil</li>

<li>Kosher Salt</li>

<li>Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>

<li>Honey</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the peaches should not be overripe or they'll turn to mush on the hot grill. </p>

<p>Cut peaches in half and remove the pit. Brush the flesh side of each peach with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.Grill peaches, flesh side down, over direct-high heat until nice grill marks form (about 2 minutes), flip and grill on the skin side for another two minutes. </p>

<p>Serve drizzled with honey as a desert or side dish. </p>
