
			<p>Part of my <strong>Father's Day</strong> gift is I get to stay home and cook for my extended family. It seems like an odd gift, I know, but if you understand <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/04/why-we-cook.html">why I cook</a> then you'll get it. Anyway, I've been considering the <strong>menu</strong> for about a week now and, barring any last-minute grocery store mishaps, here's what I have planned so far:</p>

<p>I'll post recipes for everything (I can't promise when, but as soon as I can). Feel free to post a comment if you can think of a good addition to the above - I'm always looking for new ideas and I seem to be missing some poultry.... </p>
