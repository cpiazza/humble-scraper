<p>From my experience, you mostly can't go wrong by adding cheese to a savory dish. I mean, if it can be used to trick unsuspecting children into eating their broccoli, surely this is some kind of super food. Which is just one reason why I've always been fascinated by <strong>Potatoes Au Gratin</strong>. I've never made them in the past because I'm generally not to fond of cream sauces, but I finally gave in to the potato-cheese-siren.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 Idaho Potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch rounds</li>
<li>2 Sweet Potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch rounds</li>
<li>2 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>3 Tbs White Flour</li>
<li>2 Cups Half and Half</li>
<li>2 Cloves of Garlic, peeled and smashed with the back of your chef's knife</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
<li>1 1/2 Cups Grated Gruyere Cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees.</p>
<p>Warm a medium sauce pan over medium heat. Melt the butter in the pan, then add the flour and whisk till fully combined. Continue whisking for one minute more, then add the Half and Half and garlic cloves. Raise the heat to high and continue whisking till the mixture starts to come to a boil. Make sure there are no lumps, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring every minute or so. </p>
<p>In a rectangular baking dish or casserole, layer first he white potatoes, then the sweet potatoes. </p>
<p>Add one cup of the cheese along with the salt and pepper to the cream mixture and stir to combine. Pour the sauce over the potatoes in the baking dish, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and add the remaining 1/2 cup of grated cheese over the top of the potatoes - then back in the oven, uncovered, for another 20 minutes.</p>
<p>You'll need a good sized serving spoon to dish this one out... </p>
