<p>It's much too early in the season for corn, so I'm constantly looking for a starch to add to my grill-everything meals. Potatoes are an obvious choice but I'm getting a little tired of the basic baked potato. On the heels of the <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/sweet-potatoes.html">roasted sweet potato recipe</a> I tried recently, I decided to try out a spiced oil rub / dressing for <strong>grilled white potatoes</strong>. </p>

<p>I left them unpeeled because I like the texture contrast you get when the skins get crispy. Even my eight year old liked them, so they can't be all bad. </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 Idaho Potatoes </li>

<li>1 Lime </li>

<li>1 Tbs <a type="amzn">Chili Powder</a> </li>

<li>1 Tsp <a type="amzn">Ground Coriander</a> </li>

<li>3 Tbs <a type="amzn">Extra Virgin Olive Oil</a> </li>

<li>1 Tsp <a type="amzn">Kosher Salt</a> </li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Rinse potatoes under cold water and scrub with the palm of your hand to remove any dirt. Dry thoroughly with paper towels. </p>

<p>Combine the juice from the lime with the chili powder, coriander, olive oil, salt and pepper in a small mixing bowl. Stir well to combine. </p>

<p>Cut potatoes into quarters (do not peel the potatoes first). Brush the flesh side of each potato quarter with the chili-lime mixture. </p>

<p>Grill potato quarters flesh side down over direct-high heat until you get good grill marks on each (about 2-3 minutes). Flip potatoes to skin side down and move off to the side of the grill. Baste flesh site of potatoes again with chili-lime mixture. Continue to grill over indirect heat, with grill covered, another 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.</p>

<p>When done, drizzle remaining chili lime mixture on top of potatoes and serve hot.   </p>
