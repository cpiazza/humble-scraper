<p>It's much too early in the season for corn, so I'm constantly looking for a starch to add to my grill-everything meals. Potatoes are an obvious choice but I'm getting a little tired of the basic baked potato. On the heels of the <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/sweet-potatoes.html">roasted sweet potato recipe</a> I tried recently, I decided to try out a spiced oil rub / dressing for <strong>grilled white potatoes</strong>. </p>

<p>I left them unpeeled because I like the texture contrast you get when the skins get crispy. Even my eight year old liked them, so they can't be all bad. </p>
