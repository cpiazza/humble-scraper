<p>I work. That is, I have a job that occupies a good deal of my time. And, like many working folk out there, weekday dinners too often get left to take-out or ham and cheese. To avoid this scenario as often as possible I cook large amounts of food on the weekend and make do with left overs during the week (not the only one, I'm sure). My favorite thing to do with <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/citrus-chicken.html">grilled chicken</a> is to make <strong>quesadillas</strong>. With the right ingredients on hand, the come together very quickly and are ready by the time you've changed out of your work clothes. </p>
