<p>I work. That is, I have a job that occupies a good deal of my time. And, like many working folk out there, weekday dinners too often get left to take-out or ham and cheese. To avoid this scenario as often as possible I cook large amounts of food on the weekend and make do with left overs during the week (not the only one, I'm sure). My favorite thing to do with <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/citrus-chicken.html">grilled chicken</a> is to make <strong>quesadillas</strong>. With the right ingredients on hand, the come together very quickly and are ready by the time you've changed out of your work clothes. </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Grilled Boneless Chicken Breast (try this <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/citrus-chicken.html">Citrus Chicken Recipe</a>)</li>

<li>1/4 Cup Fresh Salsa (try <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/salsa.html">this recipe</a>)</li>

<li>1/2 Grated Cheddar Cheese</li>

<li>2 Whole Wheat Tortillas</li>

<li>Dollop of Sour Cream</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</p>

<p>Slice grilled chicken into thin strips.</p>

<p>Lay one of the tortillas on a <a type="amzn">baking sheet</a>. Top with one layer of chicken, then one layer of cheese, then one layer of salsa. Cover with the remaining tortilla and slide it into the oven. </p>

<p>Go take off that tie, change into comfy shorts, and return in about 15 minutes. </p>

<p>Remove the quesadilla from the oven, cut into quarters and serve with that dollop of sour cream and a little more of the salsa. </p>
