Never having resembled anything close to a vegetarian, I was skeptical when it was recommended to me. But I was poor, having just moved into my first apartment in New York City and I figured broccoli was less expensive than chicken or steak. </p>

<p>This cookbook was written by <a href="http://www.molliekatzen.com/"><strong>Mollie Katzen</strong></a> when she was a member of the Moosewood Collective in Ithaca, NY. It has since been named to the James Beard Foundation Cookbook Hall of Fame (2007), has several million copies in print, and has been named by the NY Times as one of the best selling cookbooks of all time.</p>

<p>Over the years, Moosewood has taught me how to make good veggie stock (which I use for everything now), fantastic guacamole, and the best black bean soup I've ever had. I can't recommend this volume enough - soups, stews, appetizers, and main courses that all bring out some fantastic flavor. </p>
