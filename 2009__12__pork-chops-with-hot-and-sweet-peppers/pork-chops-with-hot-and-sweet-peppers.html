<p>Last night we went out with a few of the neighbors - sort of a holiday-couples-night-out. For me, the best part is that it was a good reason to send the kids to the in-laws for the weekend. Ahhh, sleep. And peace and quiet. And a clean house. I could keep going, but what I really wanted to say was that I ordered the house special, which inspired me to make something similar. Both were quite good.</p>
