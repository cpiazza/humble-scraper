<p>Last night we went out with a few of the neighbors - sort of a holiday-couples-night-out. For me, the best part is that it was a good reason to send the kids to the in-laws for the weekend. Ahhh, sleep. And peace and quiet. And a clean house. I could keep going, but what I really wanted to say was that I ordered the house special, which inspired me to make something similar. Both were quite good.</p>

Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-4 Pork Chops</li>
<li>6 Peppers, a mix of sweet and hot, seeded and cut into strips.</li>
<li>1 Clove of Garlic, minced</li>
<li>2 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>3/4 Cup Chicken Stock</li>
<li>1 Tbs Cider Vinegar</li>
<li>1 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>8-10 Leaves of Fresh Sage</li>
<li>Kosher Salt and Fresh Ground Black Pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>Get a heavy skillet HOT over a high flame, then add the olive oil. Salt and Pepper your chops on both sides, then add to the hot pan. Brown well on both sides, 2-3 minutes per side. </p>
<p>Remove the chops from the pan, then add the peppers. Saute the peppers 3-4 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Now add the chicken stock to the pan, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. </p>
<p>Return the pork chops to the pan, cover, and cook for 10 minutes longer. </p>
<p>Remove the chops again and set them on your serving plate. Add the vinegar and butter to the pan and whisk to combine. Raise heat to medium and cook until the sauce reduces by half. </p>
<p>Add the fresh sage to the sauce, stir, and pour it all over those chops which have been waiting patiently on that serving platter. </p>
