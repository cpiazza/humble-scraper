<p>I've been wanting to make Jerk Chicken for quite some time.</p>

<p>The problem is that the rest of my family are a bunch of tender-footed pansies when it comes to spicy food. Real Jerk Chicken would likely be the demise of them all. Of course, then there'd be more for me to eat. But in the end I like my family more than chicken, so I go easy on them. </p>

<p>Thus, this recipe was born of compromise. Black Cardamom and Allspice are the dominant flavors in the <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/dry_rubs/index.html">dry rub</a>, and slow cooking on the grill keeps the chicken tender. </p>
