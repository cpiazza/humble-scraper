<p>I've been wanting to make Jerk Chicken for quite some time.</p>

<p>The problem is that the rest of my family are a bunch of tender-footed pansies when it comes to spicy food. Real Jerk Chicken would likely be the demise of them all. Of course, then there'd be more for me to eat. But in the end I like my family more than chicken, so I go easy on them. </p>

<p>Thus, this recipe was born of compromise. Black Cardamom and Allspice are the dominant flavors in the <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/dry_rubs/index.html">dry rub</a>, and slow cooking on the grill keeps the chicken tender. </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Tbs Coriander Seeds</li>

<li>1 Tbs Allspice Seeds</li>

<li>1 Tbs Light Brown Sugar</li>

<li>5-6 Pods of Black Cardamom</li>

<li>1 Tsp Cinnamon</li>

<li>1 Tsp Chili Powder</li>

<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>

<li>Chicken Parts (I used 3 Bone-in Breasts and 4 Thighs)</li>
</ul>

<p>Combine the coriander, allspice, sugar, cardamom, cinnamon, chili powder, salt, and pepper in a spice mill. Pulse until everything is well combined. Generously coat all sides of each chicken piece and let stand at room temperature for 30 - 45 minutes before grilling.</p>

<p>Grill, skin side up with the grill covered, over indirect-medium (300 - 325) heat for about 60 minutes. </p>

<p>As ever, I recommend a good smokey charcoal and the immediate abandonment of your gas grill for this and all future grilling. </p>
