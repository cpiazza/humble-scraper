<p><strong>Chicken Piccata</strong> was always one of my mom's favorite dishes. I remember her ordering it regularly when we were kids and went to Lamanda's Restaurant (the place also had great clams oreganato - I wonder if it's still there...). So when her birthday rolled around this year, I decided to bring back this classic. It's a simple dish that comes together quickly and easily. It might be making regular appearances around our house from now on. </p>

Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-6 Chicken Breasts</li>
<li>1/4 Cup All Purpose Flour</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
<li>4 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>4 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1 Shallot, diced</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Chicken Stock</li>
<li>Juice from 2 Lemons</li>
<li>15 (or so) Capers</li>
<li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p>
Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap and, using the flat side of a <a type="amzn">meat tenderizer</a>, pound out the chicken till it's about 1/2-inch thick. </p>
<p>Combine the flour, salt, and pepper in a pie plate. Mix well, then dredge each piece of chicken on all sides. Shake well to remove any excess. </p>
<p>Heat the 2 Tbs of olive oil and 2 Tbs of butter in a large skillet. When the butter starts to sizzle, start browning the chicken breasts. Brown each about two minutes per side, and work in batches if you need to. </p>
<p>When all the chicken is browned, remove from the pan. Add 2 more Tbs of olive oil to the pan, then toss in the shallots. Saute for about 1 minute, then add the chicken stock and the lemon juice. Raise the heat to high and as the liquid starts to boil, scrape up any brown bits that have formed on the bottom of the pan. </p>
<p>Reduce heat to medium, add the capers, and return the chicken to the pan. Cook for three minutes, flip over all the chicken pieces, then cook for another three minutes. Add the remaining 2 Tbs of butter and mix well. Pour the whole pan into a serving dish and top with fresh chopped parsley.</p>
