<p><strong>Chicken Piccata</strong> was always one of my mom's favorite dishes. I remember her ordering it regularly when we were kids and went to Lamanda's Restaurant (the place also had great clams oreganato - I wonder if it's still there...). So when her birthday rolled around this year, I decided to bring back this classic. It's a simple dish that comes together quickly and easily. It might be making regular appearances around our house from now on. </p>
