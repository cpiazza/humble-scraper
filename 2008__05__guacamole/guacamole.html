<p><strong>Guacamole</strong> is one of those dishes that is so incredibly easy to make and yet I find lots of folks who think it can only be obtained from a mexican restaurant. Well, I'm here to lead the avocado revolution and say that you, too, can make good, fresh, <strong>guacamole</strong> in your very own kitchen. And you can do it in about 5 minutes. Read on, intrepid soul.</p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 Ripe Avocados, roughly mashed</li>

<li>1/2 of a Medium Red Onion, chopped</li>

<li>2 Medium Tomatoes, diced</li>

<li>2 Garlic Cloves, crushed</li>

<li>Juice from 1 Lemon</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1 Tsp <a type="amzn">Chili Powder</a>
</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp <a type="amzn">Ground Coriander</a>
</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix it all together and there you have it. I prefer my guacamole on the chunky side, but the texture is directly proportional to how aggressive you are when mashing the avocados. So after a long, hard, day at the office you may end up with a creamier product.</p>

<p>Fetch a bag of <a type="amzn">tortilla chips</a> and dig in.</p>
