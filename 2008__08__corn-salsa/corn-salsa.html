<p>As the summer draws to a close more and more fresh <strong>corn</strong> will be available at your local farm-stand-on-a-dusty-corner. I tend to buy too many ears than we can possibly eat at one sitting but, as I've mentioned many times, leftovers make me happy. Here's a quick <strong>salsa</strong> to use up all that leftover grilled-or-boiled corn you're sure to have this season.</p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Ear of corn. Boiled or roasted, preferably white and sweet.</li>

<li>2 <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/roasted-peppers.html">Roasted peppers</a>, preferably roasted by you and not out of a jar.</li>

<li>Juice from 1 Lime</li>

<li>1 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>1 1/2 Tsps <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMcCormick-Ancho-Chili-Pepper-1-62%2Fdp%2FB0010AT2RQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dgourmet-food%26qid%3D1216087060%26sr%3D1-10&amp;tag=humblerecipes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Ancho Chili Powder</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=humblerecipes-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;">
</li>

<li>1 1/2 Tsps Ground Corriander</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove the corn from the cob. The best way I know to do this is to chop off about 1/4 inch from the wide end (not the narrow tapered end), then stand the ear up on this newly created flat-end and slice down with a good sharp knife. Watch your fingers, please.</p>

<p>Discard the cob (or make a pipe, your preference).</p>

<p>Add all ingredients in a medium bowl and mix well. Goes great on meats or fish and keeps for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. </p>
