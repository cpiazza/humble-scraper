<p><strong>Broccoli Rabe</strong> reminds me of winter and of my father. My mother, an excellent cook, rarely made it for him so I'd often prepare a batch when they'd come over for dinner. This is the way he liked it, with lots of garlic and red pepper. </p>

<p>(I'm not really sure why it reminds me of winter).</p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Bunch of Broccoli Rabe</li>

<li>1/4 Cup of Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>5-6 Cloves of Garlic, cut into large dice</li>

<li>1 Tsp Red Pepper Flakes</li>

<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1/2 Cup of Water</li>
</ul>

<p>Trim the bottom 1/2 inch off the broccoli, then rinse to remove and surface dirt and place into colander to drain (it's okay if it doesn't become completely dry).Â  </p>

<p>In a large skillet, place the olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper flakes. Heat over a medium-high flame until the garlic just starts to brown. Add the broccoli rabe to the pan and, using a tongs, toss to coat with the oil. Add the water to the pan, then cover. Continue to cook, covered, about 10 minutes. Don't over cook - you want the broccoli to retain some firmness. </p>
