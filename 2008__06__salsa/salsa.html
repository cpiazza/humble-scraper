<p>I really dislike canned / jarred <strong>salsa</strong>. The texture is often too pasty and there's zero freshness when all that really matters in good salsa is fresh ingredients. I like to balance mine with a bit of sweetness. Sometimes I'll use fruit (mango, for example) and sometimes I'll use roasted peppers. Roasting your own peppers takes a little more time, but it makes the dish.</p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 Red Bell Peppers</li>

<li>2 Yellow Bell Peppers</li>

<li>3 Medium Ripe Tomatoes, diced</li>

<li>1 Clove Garlic, diced</li>

<li>1/2 Small Red Onion, diced</li>

<li>Juice from 1 Large Lime</li>

<li>1 Tsp Cumin</li>

<li>1/2 Chopped Fresh Cilantro</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>The peppers need to be roasted first. This can be done well ahead of time - you can check out this <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/roasted-peppers.html">roasted peppers</a> post for how I like to do it. Remove the skins from the peppers, dice, and place in a large mixing bowl (feel free to dump in any pepper-roasting juices that may be left over).</p>

<p>Add remaining ingredients, mix well, and serve.</p>
