 <br>Once the cold weather starts to set in here in the northeast, my cooking habit turns toward soups and stews. As much as I enjoy doing as much from scratch as possible, I rarely have the leftover animal bones required to make beef or chicken stock. </p>
<p>A much easier way to prepare homemade stock is to go the veggie route. I find that it's much easier to collect save the stems, peels, tops and bottoms of various vegetables than it is to keep some chicken bones laying around. Every time I chop or peel a vegetable, the bit I'd usually toss in the trash (or compost heap, if I had one), I simply add to a ziploc bag in the fridge. After about a week or two, I have enough to make a richly flavored stock.</p>

		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>The specifics and quantity here are tricky. You'll need, at least, an amount equal to a 2 gallon ziploc back that is half full. What I find works best are the raw (uncooked) remains of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Sweet Peppers</li>
<li>Onions</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Fresh Herbs</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Zucchini</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Cabbage</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay away from eggplant as it tends to be too bitter. If you use Celery or Cabbage, use it sparingly as their flavors will dominate the stock. </p>
<p>Place your vegetable debris into a large stock pot and add water to cover by at least two inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for about 45 minutes, or until all the vegetables are very soft. </p>
<p>Drain the resulting stock away from the vegetables using a colander and a large bowl. Use immediately or freeze for up to four weeks. </p>
