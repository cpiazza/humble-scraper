<p>This boozy recipe is inspired by the Smitten Kitchen.  The recipe was modified to more accurately represent a Car Bomb cocktail and create a lighter, more delicious treat.  A traditional Car Bomb begins with a shot of Irish cream that has Irish whiskey floating on top.  The shot is placed in a glass of Irish stout, where it must be immediately consumed, often ushering the consumer into a late night filled with drunken antics.</p>
<p>In order to accurately represent the famous drink, the cupcake is made with an Irish stout beer, filled with an Irish cream chocolate ganache, and frosted with an Irish whiskey frosting.  The original recipe uses Irish cream in the frosting and whiskey in the ganache.  Putting the Irish cream inside the cupcake more accurately portrays the drink.</p>
<p>Additionally, creating a light and delicious cupcake is always a fun MO.  Instead of the original frosting recipe, an italian meringue butter cream was used because I've been on a kick lately.  They are divine and not overly sweet, but take extra time.  Additionally, some ingredients were changed to prevent greasiness and procure delicacy. </p>
<p>The recipe creates 24 cupcakes.  The frosting recipe will generate about 4 cups of frosting, which can be stretched to frost 48 cupcakes if modestly frosted, see posted pictures. </p>
