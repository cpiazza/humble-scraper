<p>Finally, we found something my younger son will eat at a Mexican restaurant. Okay, so, he doesn't eat the whole fajita - no tortilla or sour cream or salsa or guacamole or peppers or onions or anything - just the steak. But, it let's us go out as a family to somewhere other than the Chicken Nugget Emporium. </p>It also prompted me to try out <strong>Stake Fajitas</strong> at home. It always seemed like it would be pretty straight forward and, in the end, it was. <p></p>
		
			 Ingredients:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>2lbs Skirt Steak</li>
<li>1 Beer</li>
<li>2 Limes</li>
<li>3 Cloves of Garlic, diced</li>
<li>3 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Honey</li>
<li>1 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
<li>1/2 Cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
<li>1 Yellow Onion, cut into strips</li>
<li>1 Red Bell Pepper, cut into strips</li>
<li>1 Green Bell Pepper, cut into strips</li>
</ul>
<p>Into a large bowl, squeeze the juice from the limes then drop in the lime halves. Add the beer, garlic, honey, olive oil, cumin, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Whisk well until combined. Add the steak to the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for 2-3 hours. </p>
<p>Remove steak from refrigerator and marinade and let stand about 45 minutes before you're ready to cook it - this will allow it to come to room temperature. After you take the steak from the marinade, toss the peppers and onions in and let stem stay there until you cook them.</p>
<p>Heat a large, heavy, skillet over high heat. When the skillet is HOT, add the steak. Cook ~5 minutes per side, then remove from the skillet and let rest for 10 minutes. While the steak is resting, add your peppers and onions to the pan and saute till just tender. </p>
<p>Slice steak into strips after it's rested for 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Serve with warmed corn tortillas, <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/salsa.html">salsa</a>,  <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/guacamole.html">guacamole</a>, and sour cream.</p>
