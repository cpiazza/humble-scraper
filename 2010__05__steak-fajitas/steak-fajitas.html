<p>Finally, we found something my younger son will eat at a Mexican restaurant. Okay, so, he doesn't eat the whole fajita - no tortilla or sour cream or salsa or guacamole or peppers or onions or anything - just the steak. But, it let's us go out as a family to somewhere other than the Chicken Nugget Emporium. </p>It also prompted me to try out <strong>Stake Fajitas</strong> at home. It always seemed like it would be pretty straight forward and, in the end, it was. <p></p>
