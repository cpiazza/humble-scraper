<p>I've only made these twice, but each time they were well received. I'd be interested to hear how other folks prepare stuffed mushrooms. It seems to me there are lots of options here. Anyway, here's how I do it.</p>

		
			<p>
Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Lb Mushrooms</li>
<li>4 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1/4 Lb <a type="amzn">Pancetta</a>, diced</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Yellow Onion, cut into small dice</li>
<li>1/4 Cup Red Bell Pepper, cut into small dice</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Plain Bread Crumbs</li>
<li>1/4 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
<li>1 Tbs Fresh Thyme</li>
<li>1/4 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees.</p>
<p>Clean the mushrooms using a damp cloth or <a type="amzn">mushroom brush</a>, being sure to remove and exterior dirt. Remove stems from the mushroom caps, cut them into small dice, and set aside (you'll be using the stems for the stuffing).</p>
<p>Heat a large saute pan over medium high heat and add 2 Tbs of the olive oil. Brown the pancetta in the oil until crisp - about five minutes. Using a <a type="amzn">slotted spoon</a>, remove the pancetta from the pan leaving behind as much of the oil as possible - save the pancetta, you'll be adding it back to the stuffing soon. Reduce heat to medium, and add the onion. Saute the onion about one minute, then add the bell pepper. Continue to saute until the pepper is soft and the onion is translucent (about 3-4 more minutes). Add the diced mushroom stems to the pan and raise the heat to high. If the pan seems a bit dry, add 1-2 Tbs more olive oil. Cook, stirring frequently, another 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Transfer the mushroom, onion and pepper mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add the cooked pancetta, along with the bread crubms, cheese, 2 Tbs olive oil, thyme, and pepper. Mix well (you'll likely need to use your hands). </p>
<p>Arrange the mushroom caps (open side up, obviously) on a large <a type="amzn">cookie sheet</a>. Depending on the size of the mushroom cap, fill each with 1-2 Tbs of the stuffing mixture. Drizzle each with a bit more olive oil and then bake in your preheated oven for 1 hour.</p>
