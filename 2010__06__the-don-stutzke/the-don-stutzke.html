<p>There are times when respect needs to be paid. </p>
<p>You've seen the movies. A kiss on the pinky ring, an envelope full of money. But for those who know him, you understand that those petty tributes mean nothing to "The Don" Stutzke. He deserves a higher honor. Nothing less than having a sandwich named after him.</p>
<p>You know, like in a deli.</p>

			<br>Ingredients<br><ul>
<li>2lbs Skirt Steak</li>
<li>2 Cloves of Garlic, chopped</li>
<li>1 Tbs Chipotle Chili Powder</li>
<li>1 Tbs Honey</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1 Bunch Fresh Arugula</li>
<li>1 Large Onion, sliced</li>
<li>8-9 White Mushrooms, sliced</li>
<li>Blue Cheese</li>
<li>Kosher Salt</li>
<li>Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
<li>Good Crusty Bread</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare the marinade. In a large mixing bowl, combine the garlic,1/4 cup of olive oil, the chili powder, honey, and 1 tsp each of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Whisk well, add the steak and make sure all sides are coated. Set on the counter top to marinate for 30-60 minutes. In the end, the meat should be at room temperature.</p>
<p>Heat the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, reduce heat to low and add the mushrooms along with 1/2 tsp of salt. Saute 4-5 minutes, then add the onions. along with a bit more salt and ground pepper to taste. Let these cook over LOW heat for 45 minutes or so, stirring occasionally. The slow cooking will bring out the sweetness in the onions without burning them.</p>
<p>Prepare your coals (hardwood, please). If you must use a gas grill, crank the heat to HIGH. Grill the steak over direct-high heat for 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from grill and let rest 7-8 minutes before slicing. Remember to slice the meat against the grain.</p>
<p>Assemble the sandwich as follows - </p>
<p>Arugula on the bottom, topped by a health pile of the mushrooms and onions, then the steak, then the cheese. Cap with the upper crust of the bread and think of The Don while you enjoy. </p>
