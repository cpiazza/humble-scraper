<p>When I was younger, my mom learned how to make <strong>Spanish style chicken and rice</strong> from a neighbor of ours. There were a few other latino-influenced dished she picked up along the way, but this is one she made frequently. </p>
<p>Once I was on my own and cooking for myself, this dish quickly became a habit of mine. I've mentioned a few times in this space that I've never had much time to cook on weekdays, so I'm big on dishes that can be prepared in large batches and refrigerated / frozen for mass quantities of leftovers. This is one of those dishes (but don't freeze this one - the rice doesn't revive itself so well. That said, it keeps nicely in the fridge for 7-10 days).</p>
<p>The original recipe I learned from my mom called for two Goya products - <a type="amzn">Recaito</a> and <a type="amzn">Saz√≥n</a> - as the main seasonings. Those are fine products but as I got older I preferred to use as little prepared products as possible and do as much from scratch as my talents and available time would allow. So I've replaced both of those with some fresh herbs, veggies, and dried spices. The end product doesn't taste exactly like the one mom used to make, but you can still find some behind the milk, waiting to be heated up after a long day at work, fairly often.</p>
