<p>Five years ago, I decided it was time to replace my aging gas grill. At the time, I was on the fence about whether to stick with gas-heat, or go with charcoal.</p>

<p>I was persuaded by a friend to abandon the notion of another gas grill. "No Flavor," he said. I liked the idea of grilling meats over a super-hot heat source, but wasn't crazy about having to worry about lighting coals every time I wanted to have a steak. </p>
