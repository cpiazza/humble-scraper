<p>Five years ago, I decided it was time to replace my aging gas grill. At the time, I was on the fence about whether to stick with gas-heat, or go with charcoal.</p>

<p>I was persuaded by a friend to abandon the notion of another gas grill. "No Flavor," he said. I liked the idea of grilling meats over a super-hot heat source, but wasn't crazy about having to worry about lighting coals every time I wanted to have a steak. </p>
		
			<p>That's when I happened upon the <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWeber-841001-Performer-Charcoal-Touch-N-Go%2Fdp%2FB000659KDM%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dhome-garden%26qid%3D1211152788%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=humblerecipes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Weber Performer</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=humblerecipes-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ; margin: 0px;"></strong>.
What's genius about this product is that it comes with a small gas tank
that's use solely for starting the coals. This allows you to get your
grill going in a relatively short time without having to mess with a
chimney starter or, worse, lighter fluid. </p>

<p>The grill comes with a handy prep surface that's great for setting
down dishes piled high with marinated meats, lightly oiled veggies, and
un-husked corn as they await their turn on the fire. This grill is also
excellent for the art of indirect cooking - cooking food more slowly
and not directly over the hot coals gives a very tender and flavorful
product. This is the only way to cook certain items - ribs and pulled
pork for example. </p>

<p>When using this grill, I recommend using a natural hardwood charcoal product. I'm a big fan of the <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRoyal-Oak-Charcoal-192294148-each%2Fdp%2FB000U7JB44%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dhome-garden%26qid%3D1211156942%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=humblerecipes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Royal Oak</a></strong><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=humblerecipes-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ; margin: 0px;"> brand, which lends a nice smoky flavor to the food. </p>

<p>Overall, the unit has held up great over the years. The main
assembly remains solid and only the push-button ignition has needed to
be replaced. In all, I'm very happy with this grill and highly
recommend it to anyone looking for a true grill experience.Â  </p>
