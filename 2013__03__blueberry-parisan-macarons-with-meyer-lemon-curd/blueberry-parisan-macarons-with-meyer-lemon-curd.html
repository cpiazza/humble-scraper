<p>A Parisan Macaron is a sweet meringue-based treat made with egg whites and ground almonds. The macaron is commonly filled with ganache<em>, </em>buttercream, jam or curd sandwiched between two cookies. Not to be confused with Macaroons, which are commonly made with coconut, this delicacy is found at French bakeries in a variety of flavors and colors.</p>
<p>The base recipe author is Hisako Ogita in "I Love Macarons."  I had to make a number of adjustments as her recipe did not work out the first couple of batches.  They tasted teriffic, but were slightly off for one reason or another.</p>
<p>It takes practice to master the art of baking Macarons.  Those seen in the photo are not perfect visually, but they taste great.  This recipe is 100% gluten free, and worth the effort. </p>
<p>Yields 18 - 22 cookies</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp water</li>
<li>5 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
<li>2/3 c ground almonds or almond meal</li>
<li>1 1/2 cup Organic powdered sugar</li>
<li>3 large egg whites, room temp</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 tbsp dried blueberries, ground in food processor</li>
<li>1/4 tsp cream of tartar</li>
</ul>
<h3>DIRECTIONS </h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare cookie sheets<ol>
<li>Cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit snugly inside of a cookie sheet.</li>
<li>Place cookie sheet on top of another cookie sheet, and set aside</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Process dry ingredients in food processor<ol>
<li>Sift ingredients (Almond meal, powdered sugar, blueberry powder) together twice</li>
<li>Store in refrigerator until Meringue step is complete</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make the meringue<ol>
<li>Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in mixer, and beat until stiff peaks</li>
<li>In a small sauce pan, combine the granulated sugar and water<ol>
<li>Heat until 240 F</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add syrup (at 240 F) to the meringue, and beat until the bowl is room temperature to the touch</li>
<li>Add the vanilla</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Combine all ingredients (very important to follow exactly)<ol>
<li>Add half of the dry ingredients to the meringue.<ol>
<li>Stir with spatula while scooping up from bottom of bowl</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add remaining dry ingredients, stirring in a circular motion</li>
<li>Macaronage<ol>
<li>Press the batter against the sides of the bowl , scoop the batter up from the bottom and flip over</li>
<li>Repeat this 15 times<ol>
<li>Do this step at least 10 and at most 20 times</li>
<li>The batter is ready when it is firm and slowly drips from a spatula</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Put batter into a pastry bag, and squeeze onto prepared cookie sheet as little circles.</li>
<li>Rap the cookie sheet firmly against the counter to form the pied, or foot of the macaron.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 315 F</li>
<li>Dry the batter for at least 15 minutes<ol>
<li>The batter is ready when the macarons do not stick to your finger when touched.</li>
<li>I've had to dry them as little as 15 and as long as an hour.  The key is to keep checking as too much drying will prevent the pied from forming and too little will cause cracks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Place cookie sheet in oven, and bake for 15 - 20 minutes. <ol>
<li>Rotate half way through.</li>
<li>Bake until slightly crispy on the top.  The cookies ultimately should be a little gooey on the inside, but not under cooked.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Allow cookies to cool.</li>
<li>Using the recipe for <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2012/12/meyer-lemon-curd.html" target="_blank" title="Meyer Lemon Curd Recipe">Meyer Lemon Curd</a>, spread curd on one cookie and place another on top.</li>
<li>The Macarons will last for about 1 week in the refrigerator, sealed.</li>
</ol>
