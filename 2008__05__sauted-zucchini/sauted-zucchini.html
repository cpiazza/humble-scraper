<p>I was going for something slightly different. Inspired by a dish we had at <a href="http://www.mulinos.us/">Mulino's</a> in White Plains, NY, I wanted a more caramelized <strong>zucchini</strong> version of what you see in the picture. I'm going to try again in the near future. For now, however, this one will do nicely while I continue to experiment. And, by the way, that's the great thing about keeping this up. Like I needed another reason to cook. </p>
