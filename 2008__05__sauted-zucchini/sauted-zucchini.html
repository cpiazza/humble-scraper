<p>I was going for something slightly different. Inspired by a dish we had at <a href="http://www.mulinos.us/">Mulino's</a> in White Plains, NY, I wanted a more caramelized <strong>zucchini</strong> version of what you see in the picture. I'm going to try again in the near future. For now, however, this one will do nicely while I continue to experiment. And, by the way, that's the great thing about keeping this up. Like I needed another reason to cook. </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 Medium <strong>Zucchini</strong>
</li>

<li>2 Cloves of Garlic, chopped</li>

<li>3 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>8 Sprigs of Fresh Thyme, leaves removed from stems</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
</ul>

Heat a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAll-Clad-Stainless-13-Inch-French-Skillet%2Fdp%2FB000RAAOKE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dhome-garden%26qid%3D1211941131%26sr%3D1-2&amp;tag=humblerecipes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" rel="nofollow">heavy skillet</a><img height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=humblerecipes-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" border="0" style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none"> over a medium-high flame. When the pan is hot, add olive oil and then zucchini. Stir a couple times so that all zucchini slices are well coated in olive oil, then spread out the slices as evenly as possible. Lower heat to medium-low and let cook undisturbed for 7-8 minutes. Using a spatula, turn zucchini and let cook for another 5-6 minutes. Add chopped garlic to the pan, stir, and cook another 2 minutes. Add salt and fresh thyme, transfer to serving bowl, and eat. </p>
