<p>This is adapted from two recipes.  My initial recipe from Epicurious tastes fabulous and is exceptionally moist, however it tastes more like a muffin than a "cornbread" muffin.  I found another recipe that uses equal parts corn meal and flour, and adapted the changes to the original.  Fresh corn was added to give the muffins a real cornbread feel.  Many fruits can be substituted for the blueberries, including mangos and strawberries.  <br><br>This recipe makes 24 muffins or two 8 x 8 pans.</p>
