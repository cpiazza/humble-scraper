<p>The folks at HumbleRecipes are excited to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.feederly.com" target="_self">Feederly.com</a>!</p>
<p>Feederly is a brand new (launched just yesterday!) online marketing solution built specifically for the small / mid sized caterer.</p>

		
			
With our initial launch, you can:<br>
<ul>
<li>List your catering business, complete with logo, contact information (including URL to your primary web site), and full description.</li>
<li>Create unlimited menus, each with unlimited dishes that can include pictures and text.
- Once listed, you can be found in our site search by cuisine type, location, or business name.</li>
<li>Have your pages picked up by Google, Bing, Yahoo, and all other search engines - the more pages you create on Feederly, the greater chance your business will be found!</li>
<li>Gain access to all future features (connect to your Yelp listing, social media integration, and more...)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Caterers can <a href="http://www.feederly.com/caterer-signup" target="_self">sign up now</a> for a Free two month trial - we won't even ask for payment information yet. Once you've signed up, drop us a note at info@feederly.com and mention that you saw this blog post - we'll double your free trial period - 4 Months at No Charge!
</p>
<p>Here's the sign up link - <a href="http://www.feederly.com/caterer-signup" target="_self">http://www.feederly.com/caterer-signup
