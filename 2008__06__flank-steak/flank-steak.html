<p>The best <strong>flank steak</strong> I ever had was prepared by a co-worker some years ago and featured a Korean-style marinade for which he refused to divulge the full list of ingredients. I've never fully tried to replicate it for fear of complete failure, but I still love marinated flank steak. This one is done in an Asian style soy-based marinade, seared over direct heat, then finished off the heat.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Flank Steak (about 1 1/2 lbs)</li>
<li>1/4 Cup <a type="amzn">Soy Sauce</a>
</li>
<li>1/4 Cup <a type="amzn">Olive Oil</a>
</li>
<li>1 Tbs Fresh Ginger, chopped</li>
<li>1 Clove Garlic, chopped</li>
<li>2 Tbs <a type="amzn">Rice Wine Vinegar</a>
</li>
<li>1 Tbs Honey</li>
<li>1 Tsp <a type="amzn">Chili Flakes</a>
</li>
<li>1 Lime, juiced</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients (except the steak) in a <a type="amzn">mixing bowl</a> and whisk to combine. Place your flank steak in a large gallon sized ziploc bag then pour marinade into the bag. Get as much of the air out of the bag as you can, then seal and rotate a few times to get the marinade all over the meat. Refrigerate for up to two hours.</p>
<p>Remove meat from marinade about 1/2 hour before grilling. Wipe off excess marinade ingredients and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Grill over direct-high until a nice crust forms (about 3-4 minutes per side). Move off to the side of the grill and continue cooking, covered, about 5-7 minutes longer. Remove from grill and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting into it. Slice thinly, against the grain.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As grilling season comes to an end, the steak can be prepared on a cast iron <a type="amzn">stove top griddle</a>.</p>
