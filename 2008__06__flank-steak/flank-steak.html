<p>The best <strong>flank steak</strong> I ever had was prepared by a co-worker some years ago and featured a Korean-style marinade for which he refused to divulge the full list of ingredients. I've never fully tried to replicate it for fear of complete failure, but I still love marinated flank steak. This one is done in an Asian style soy-based marinade, seared over direct heat, then finished off the heat.</p>
