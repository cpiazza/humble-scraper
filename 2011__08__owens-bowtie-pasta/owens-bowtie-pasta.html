<p>Bowtie wearers can sometimes seem a bit too formal. Sometimes they can appear silly (think pee-wee). Sometimes indimidating (think Louis Farakhan). Sometims thought provoking (think C.Everett Koop). Sometimes annoying (think Tucker Carlson). As diverse as it's wearers are, the bowtie pasta (farfalle) is universal in it's appeal.Â  It's a great alternative to penne, or rigatoni, when you want to eat your pasta with just a fork (no twirling involved). It's also great for kids because for some reason, they love the idea of eating bowties.</p>
<p>This is a simple recipe with only a few ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>farfalle pasta - 1 pound</li>
<li>1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>red pepper flakes</li>
<li>one larg zuccini quartered and cut in small pieces</li>
<li>one red pepper - chopped</li>
<li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>fresh mozarella and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
<li>basil</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat large pot of water (with some salt)</li>
<li>Heat oil in skillet over medium heat with red pepper flakes</li>
<li>Add zuccini - cook for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Add red pepper - cook for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Add garlic</li>
<li>Add salt and pepper to taste</li>
