OK- so the basis for this recipe came from NYTimes dining section (12/2/09). You are cooking pasta slow, in a saute pan, with broth....similar to risotto. It is delicious, and an easy one-pan dinner.

-3/4 (give or take) of a pound of small/medium size pasta - break up linguini if using it
- 1 + 1/2 quart of stock (I used veggie stock, but any will do)
- 1 package of mushrooms (slice these) - baby bell are great
- small onion or 3 shallots
- 2 garlic cloves
- fresh parsley 
- fresh or frozen spinach (about 1 cup, or more)
- pine nuts - toasted in dry pan (optional)
- olive oil
- Parma or romano cheese for serving

Chop shallots (or onion) into small pieces, and saute in 3tbsp olive oil (medium heat). Add garlic. Cook both for 3 to 5 min. Add mushrooms, and cook down about 10 minutes. Next, add the pasta, and 1/2 cup of water - let the pasta get coated with liquid - about 3 minutes. Add stock, 1 cup at a time. Cook and let it get absorbed, then continue adding stock, little by little, until pasta is al dente (approx 30 minutes). Add spinach during the last 5 minutes. Add pine nuts, if desired. Garnish with fresh parsley and Romano cheese.
