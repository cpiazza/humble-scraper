<p>I mentioned in an <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/08/grilled-scallop.html">earlier post</a> the Japanese style chicken wings I'd been having for lunch last summer. They're served out of a tiny store-front on west 19th street and if you're in the neighborhood, I highly recommend giving them a try. Back in August I tried out a <strong>sweet-soy glaze</strong> for some scallops and this weekend I marinated some <strong>chicken </strong>in a similar brew and was very happy with the results. </p>
<p>They're not quite what you'll get on 19th street, but still pretty good.</p>

Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>9-10 chicken pieces (preferably legs and thighs)</li>
<li>1/4 Good Soy Sauce</li>
<li>3 Tbs Brown Sugar</li>
<li>2 Tbs Rice Wine Vinegar</li>
<li>3 Tbs Sesame Oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the soy, sugar, vinegar, and sesame oil in a large bowl. Add the chicken and marinate for at least one hour. </p>
<p>Prepare the coals in your grill for indirect cooking and bring the grill up to between 325 and 350 degrees. Begin grilling the chicken, skin side up, over indirect heat. While the chicken is starting to cook, transfer the excess marinade to a small sauce pan and place it over high heat on your stove top. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and continue to cook for 5-7 minutes. </p>
<p>Baste chicken with reduced marinade every 15 minutes or so and cook chicken for total of 1 hour (don't let the heat get above 350). If you want to crisp up the skin a bit, place the chicken skin-side-down directly over the coals for 1-2 minutes just before serving. </p>
