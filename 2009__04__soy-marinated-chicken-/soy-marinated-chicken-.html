<p>I mentioned in an <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/08/grilled-scallop.html">earlier post</a> the Japanese style chicken wings I'd been having for lunch last summer. They're served out of a tiny store-front on west 19th street and if you're in the neighborhood, I highly recommend giving them a try. Back in August I tried out a <strong>sweet-soy glaze</strong> for some scallops and this weekend I marinated some <strong>chicken </strong>in a similar brew and was very happy with the results. </p>
<p>They're not quite what you'll get on 19th street, but still pretty good.</p>
