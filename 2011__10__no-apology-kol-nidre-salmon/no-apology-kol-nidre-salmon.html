<p>This is a great quick meal on any night, but it is especially good on Kol Nidre eve, prior to your Yom Kippur fast. Plus, you won't have to do any repenting because this is pretty healthy meal. If you have committed any transgressions against your fellow man or woman, feel free to invite them- after a taste of this salmon, you are sure to be forgiven.<br><br></p>
