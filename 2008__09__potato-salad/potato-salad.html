<p>What would a summer barbecue be without <strong>potato salad</strong>? </p>

<p>Okay, I know, summer is practically over. But the calendar never stopped me from firing up the weber and as long there isn't snow on the ground, I consider it barbecue season. Well, despite the ubiquity of potato salad at cookouts across the country, I haven't made any all year.This past weekend, I figured it was about time. </p>
