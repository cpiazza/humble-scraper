<p> "What about those funny looking round things you cook in the oven and the come out all sweet and yummy?"</p>
<p>That was what my wife requested when I asked what she'd like with dinner tonight. After 11 years of marriage I'm able to decipher her code. She meant <strong>roasted butternut squash</strong>, but couldn't quite find the words. </p>
<p>Upon bringing them home, my sons were a little concerned that we'd be serving up some <a type="amzn">thanksgiving decor</a> with the rest of our dinner. One of them even ventured a bite, the brave soul.Â </p>
<p>Plan on one butternut squash for every two to three (grown) people you'll be serving. </p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 Butternut Squash</li>
<li>1 Tbs Olive Oil</li>
<li>2 Tsp <a type="amzn">Kosher Salt</a>
</li>
<li>1 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
<li>2 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>2 Tbs Light Brown Sugar</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Grated Nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees.</p>
<p>Cut each squash in half, from the stem down. Scoop out the seeds and general goop from the inner cavity. Place the squash halves skin side down in a <a type="amzn">large roasting pan</a> and drizzle with the olive oil. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Remove from the oven and in the cavity of each of the halves, place 1/2 Tbs Butter and 1/2 Tbs Light Brown Sugar. Sprinkle the fresh nutmeg over them all and return to the oven to cook for another 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Remove from the oven and, using a spoon, baste the squash with the melted sugar-butter mixture that has pooled in the middle of each half.</p>
<p>Cut each half into quarters and serve. </p>
