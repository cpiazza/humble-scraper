<p> "What about those funny looking round things you cook in the oven and the come out all sweet and yummy?"</p>
<p>That was what my wife requested when I asked what she'd like with dinner tonight. After 11 years of marriage I'm able to decipher her code. She meant <strong>roasted butternut squash</strong>, but couldn't quite find the words. </p>
<p>Upon bringing them home, my sons were a little concerned that we'd be serving up some <a type="amzn">thanksgiving decor</a> with the rest of our dinner. One of them even ventured a bite, the brave soul.Â </p>
<p>Plan on one butternut squash for every two to three (grown) people you'll be serving. </p>
