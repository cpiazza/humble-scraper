<p>Peaches en Regalia is a modern jazz fusion standard, and one of the most well known songs by music legend Frank Zappa.  The song is included in the underground version of The Real Book, which is a series of books containing compilations of popular jazz tunes that provides an indispensable resource for aspiring and current jazz musicians.  Having a song published in The Real Book is the ultimate "street cred" for a jazz composer.  My introduction and love for the song and Frank Zappa came from none other than my favorite band, Phish.  This recipe is appropriately titled as a tribute to both groups of talented musicians.</p>
<p>The recipe begins with a classic buttermilk cake recipe by Rose Levy Beranbaum that is converted into a delicate cupcake recipe.  Nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and ginger are added to spice it up.  A delicious peach preserve is injected into the center, though my original plans were to make a whiskey peach preserve from scratch (check back, as I may work on this idea).  Finally, the cupcakes are topped with a Jameson italian meringue buttercream to give the dessert pizazz.</p>
<p>Here's a great video of Phish covering Peaches en Regalia in 2009, with close-ups of Trey Anastasio rocking the solos.  Now you can really have your cake and listen to it too!</p>
