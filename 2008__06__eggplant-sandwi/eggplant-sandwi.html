<p>Leftovers make me happy. </p>

<p>That's mostly because I only really have time to cook on the weekends, but also because it allows me to create new dishes from the scraps of past ones. This <strong>Grilled Eggplant Sandwich</strong> uses the <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/grilledeggplant.html">grilled eggplant</a> I wrote about earlier. It's a summertime staple for a quick after work dinner or even a sack lunch when I don't feel like blowing $10 at the deli. As with all sandwiches, be sure to use good, fresh, bread.<br> </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Slice <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/grilledeggplant.html">Grilled Eggplant</a> </li>

<li>1 Slice Fresh Mozzarella</li>

<li>1 Slick Beefsteak Tomato</li>

<li>2 Basil Leaves</li>

<li>2 Tbs Balsamic Vinegar</li>

<li>Fresh Italian /French / Otherwise Crusty Bread</li>

<li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut a sandwich sized chunk off your bread loaf, slice in half and toast. Sprinkle Vinegar on bottom half of the toasted bread, then layer remaining ingredients and pretty much any order you see fit. Add salt and pepper to taste. Close up the sandwich and enjoy. </p>
