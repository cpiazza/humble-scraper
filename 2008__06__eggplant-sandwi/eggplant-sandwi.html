<p>Leftovers make me happy. </p>

<p>That's mostly because I only really have time to cook on the weekends, but also because it allows me to create new dishes from the scraps of past ones. This <strong>Grilled Eggplant Sandwich</strong> uses the <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/grilledeggplant.html">grilled eggplant</a> I wrote about earlier. It's a summertime staple for a quick after work dinner or even a sack lunch when I don't feel like blowing $10 at the deli. As with all sandwiches, be sure to use good, fresh, bread.<br> </p>
