
			<p>I've been thinking about creative <strong>burger recipes</strong> for a while now and have some ideas on how to move beyond the traditional patty. That said, I'd love to hear about some of your favorite burger recipes and any that I try I promise to post here and give full credit. They can be simple, or adventurous (like <a href="http://www.aldenteblog.com/2008/06/weekend-recipe.html">this one</a>), I'm up for anything new. </p>

<p>So don't be shy - post something in the comments below or send me an email (admin AT humblerecipes DOT com). Quick, I'm getting hungry. </p>
