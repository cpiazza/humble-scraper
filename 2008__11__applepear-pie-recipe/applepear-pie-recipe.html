 </p>
<p>I've never been much of a baker. </p>
<p>That is, I enjoy the free-form-ed-ness of cooking over the science of baking. I still don't know when to use baking powder over baking soda and so most of my baking begins with a cookbook. This pie began with The Algonquin's Famous Apple Pie recipe found in <a type="amzn">The New York Cookbook by Molly O'Neill</a>. I was short an ingredient here and there, thought a couple lonely pears I had would be much happier alongside some apples and cinnamon, and the result was something I was quite happy with. </p>
<p>Maybe there's a baker in me after all. </p>
