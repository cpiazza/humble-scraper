 </p>
<p>I've never been much of a baker. </p>
<p>That is, I enjoy the free-form-ed-ness of cooking over the science of baking. I still don't know when to use baking powder over baking soda and so most of my baking begins with a cookbook. This pie began with The Algonquin's Famous Apple Pie recipe found in <a type="amzn">The New York Cookbook by Molly O'Neill</a>. I was short an ingredient here and there, thought a couple lonely pears I had would be much happier alongside some apples and cinnamon, and the result was something I was quite happy with. </p>
<p>Maybe there's a baker in me after all. </p>

		
			<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>Crust</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Cups White Flour</li>
<li>1 Tbs White Sugar</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter, cut into small pieces and chilled</li>
<li>1/2 Vegetable Shortening (solid)</li>
<li>1/2 Cup COLD water</li>
</ul>
<p>
Filling</p>
<ul>
<li>6 Apples, peeled, cored, and sliced.</li>
<li>2 Pears, peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
<li>7 Tbs White Sugar</li>
<li>3 Tbs Light Brown Sugar</li>
<li>Zest from 1 Orange</li>
<li>1 Tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
<li>1/4 Tsp Fresh Grated Nutmeg</li>
<li>4 Tbs Butter, cut into small pieces</li>
</ul>
<p>
To make the crust, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Using two forks or a pastry cutter, cut the shortening and butter into the flour mixture until it resembles small peas. Add the water, a little at a time, and mix just enough until the crust comes together. Form into two equal sized balls, cover with saran wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 450 Degrees.</p>
<p>Roll out one ball of dough to about 13-inches in diameter and place in the bottom of a <a type="amzn">9-inch pie plate</a>. Add the apples and pears. In a small bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and orange zest - then sprinkle over the top of the apples/pears. Dot the fruit with 3 Tbs of butter. </p>
<p>Roll out the second ball of dough to the same size as the first and cover the pie. Using a fork, press the edges of the two crusts together. Then, using a <a type="amzn">paring knife</a>, cut away any excess dough hanging over the edges. </p>
<p>Mix together an additional 1 Tbs of White Sugar and 1 Tbs of White Flour. Sprinkle over the top of the pie then dot with the remaining 1 Tbs of butter. Using your paring knife, cut several little slits in the top pie crust to avoid a pie-explosion. </p>
<p>Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes, then lower oven to 350 degrees and bake for another 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Serve warm or cold, preferably with vanilla ice cream.</p>
