<p>Its funny how a simple event like changing jobs can flip your world inside out.  In my case, my new coworkers decided to share a delightful cold with me.  The office is small, everyone is in one room, and apparently, the germs run the office.  Half the gang has taken a sick day in the time since I started.</p>
<p>I rarely get colds.  It is extremely unusual to be coughing up a lung on a tuesday, after calling in sick to a new job no less.  Certainly my new coworkers are questioning my proclaimed super immune system.  Enter the healing soup.  Rich with nutrients from root vegetables, this soup is very soothing and grounding.  This recipe might not cure the common cold, but it will certainly prevent it.  In the future, I plan to make healing soup before entering into any new, strange germ pool.</p>
