<p>The plan was to make these beans with tomato and fresh mint. Then when my guests arrived I found out one of them couldn't have tomatoes. Faced with either telling the guest to please go home or improvising, I chose to be the gracious host.</p>

<p>I was quite happy with the resulting dish AND nobody got angry with me. It was a good day.</p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Lb of Green Beans, ends trimmed off</li>

<li>3 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>4-5 Cloves of Garlic, cut into rough chop</li>

<li>1/2 of a Red Onion, cut into long slivers</li>

<li>1/2 Cup Orange Juice</li>

<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>

<li>12-15 Fresh Mint Leaves, chopped</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the olive oil, salt, and garlic in a large, cold saute pan and place over high heat. Just as the garlic begins to sizzle, add the onions and cook for 1 minute more. Then add the green beans and orange juice, reduce heat to medium, and cover the pan. Cook for about 5-6 minutes more (covered), then remove the cover and cook for another minute. </p>

<p>Mix in the fresh mint and black pepper and serve. </p>
