 </p>
<p>This is the bread and meat <strong>stuffing </strong>we always had every <strong>Thanksgiving </strong>while I was growing up. There are a few vegetables thrown in the mix, but they're really only there for appearances. And my family never messed around with fruit in the turkey stuffing either. Some folks like apples or raisins or some other fruit that really has no business being inside a turkey. Not me. </p>
<p>A final note before we get to the details. I cook mine inside the turkey. Yes, the picture above shows the stuffing after it's been baked in a little <a type="amzn">le crueset ramekin</a>, but that's only what I do with what won't fit inside the bird. If you're nervous about salmonella (sam and ella?), you can use a <a type="amzn">meat thermometer</a> to check the middle of the stuffing for proper temperature - or simply cook it outside the turkey. </p>
