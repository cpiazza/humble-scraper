<p>I became enamored with making <strong>banana bread</strong> when I heard that the best fruit to use are the black-skinned, overripe, bananas that usually end up in the trash. There's something wholly satisfying about turning what would have otherwise been disposed of into something the kids fight over getting the first warm slice, fresh from the oven. </p>

<p>Of course, I could do without the children fighting - but you get my piont. </p>
