<p>To my constant dismay, my wife isn't a big meat eater. She'll eat a burger as long as there's "no red inside" and is pretty good about <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/citrus-chicken.html">grilled chicken</a> or <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/chicken-cutlets.html">chicken cutlets</a>, but that's about it. This is particularly troublesome during grilling season which, as far as I'm concerned, is any day the temperature is above 50 degrees. </p>

<p>Being the good husband that I am, I try not to deny her food. She'll eat most any fish and <strong>salmon</strong> is one of her favorites, so it makes a regular appearance on <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/grill-recommend.html">the weber</a>. Sometimes I make it simply, with just a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Other times I like to make it as follows, with an <strong>Asian</strong> marinade and glaze. The dominant flavors in this one are <strong>Soy</strong>, <strong>Ginger</strong>, and <strong>Lime</strong>. The salmon cooks up fast and is great as leftovers, too.<br> </p>
