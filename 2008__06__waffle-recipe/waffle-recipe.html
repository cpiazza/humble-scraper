One of the best things about weekend mornings is breakfast. Even though my boys refuse to let me sleep late on my days off from work, I still let them help me cook and the look forward to Saturday / Sunday breakfast.</p>

<p>I've already shared our <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/pancakes.html">Pancakes recipe</a> and another favorite are <strong>Waffles</strong>. We tend to alternate - pancakes Saturday and <strong>Waffles</strong> on Sunday. Like most recipes that call for flour, we use a 50-50 split of white and whole wheat to try to keep them at least a little healthy. </p>

<p>Obviously, you'll need a waffle iron. If you don't have a good one, we use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FVillaWare-V2002-UNO-Belgian-Waffler%2Fdp%2FB0007SXISG%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dhome-garden%26qid%3D1212337601%26sr%3D8-5&amp;tag=humblerecipes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">this one</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=humblerecipes-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;"> and are very happy with it. <br> </p>

<li>1 Tbs Sugar</li>

<li>1 Cup Milk</li>

<li>2 Tbs Unsalted Butter, Melted</li>

<li>1/4 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt  into a medium bowl.  </p>

<p>Beat the egg yolks and sugar in a second bowl until the yolks turn a pale yellow. Add the milk and vanilla and mix well. Then add the melted butter (make sure it's not still hot) and mix well again. </p>

<p>Combine the flour mixture and the milk-egg mixture. Stir until just combined (do not over mix). </p>

Add the egg whites to the remaining ingredients, folding in slowly. Again, be careful not to over mix as you want the beaten egg whites to add volume to the batter.</p>

<p>Follow the waffle iron's instructions for pre-heating and cooking the waffles. We like ours on the crisp side. Serve hot with butter and syrup. <br> </p>
