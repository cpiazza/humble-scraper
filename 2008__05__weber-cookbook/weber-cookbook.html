Summertime is right around the corner. Some folks wait till Memorial Day to light up the grill for the first time, but I tend to start a bit earlier.
</p>
<p>I have a number of my own recipes that are tried and true standards for me, but whenever the coals are hot and I need inspiration, I turn to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWebers-Book-Grilling-Jamie-Purviance%2Fdp%2F0811831973%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dhome-garden%26qid%3D1209951815%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=humblerecipes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">
<strong>Weber's Big Book of Grilling</strong></a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=humblerecipes-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;">. </p>

<p>This cookbook does a great job of illustrating the different grilling cooking methods (direct vs. indirect heat) while providing a fantastic collection of recipes. Some of my favorites include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cedar-Smoked Pork Loin</li>

<li>Kansas City Style Ribs</li>

<li>Pulled Pork</li>

<li>Chicken Under Bricks</li>

<li>Tequila Shrimp</li>

<li>Mexican Flank Steak</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you already have a BBQ cookbook or two on your shelf, I highly recommend this one become an addition to your library. And remember, it's never too early to start grilling!</p>
