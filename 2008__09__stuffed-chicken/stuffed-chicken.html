<p>Boneless, skinless, chicken breasts tend to be a little bland. That's why I usually use a marinade of some sort when I'm working with these. The nice thing about <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/citrus-chicken.html">marinated chicken breasts</a> is that you can keep the fat content low (which is why most people opt for this cut) and impart some nice flavor to the chicken.</p>

<p>Another option is to stuff your chicken breasts. You can get very creative going this route but with so many possibilities it's easy to lose site of the healthy aspect of the skiness chicken. Throwing caution (and calories) to the wind, I stuffed these with cheese and bacon. Some arugula was tossed in to ease the guilt.<br> </p>
