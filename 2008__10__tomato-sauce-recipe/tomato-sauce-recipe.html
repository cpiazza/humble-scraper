<p>My father called it Gravy. </p>
<p>I've always called it <strong>tomato sauce</strong>, and have fond memories of it simmering away every Sunday afternoon. The tomato sauce from my youth was always made with meat. Not that it was a "meat sauce," per se, but meat was first browned in the pot and then left to finish cooking in the pot. I like to use <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/10/meatballs-recipe.html" title="Meatballs Recipe">meatballs</a> and sweet Italian sausage, but my mom will also throw in short ribs (beef or pork) and braciole on occasion.Â </p>
<p>And so as the weather cools here in the northeast and <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/grill-recommend.html" title="Grill Recommendation">my grill</a> gets less and less use, you'll often find a pot of sauce bubbling on my stove on a sunday early evening. Feel free to call it Gravy if you like.</p>
