<p>My father called it Gravy. </p>
<p>I've always called it <strong>tomato sauce</strong>, and have fond memories of it simmering away every Sunday afternoon. The tomato sauce from my youth was always made with meat. Not that it was a "meat sauce," per se, but meat was first browned in the pot and then left to finish cooking in the pot. I like to use <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/10/meatballs-recipe.html" title="Meatballs Recipe">meatballs</a> and sweet Italian sausage, but my mom will also throw in short ribs (beef or pork) and braciole on occasion. </p>
<p>And so as the weather cools here in the northeast and <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/grill-recommend.html" title="Grill Recommendation">my grill</a> gets less and less use, you'll often find a pot of sauce bubbling on my stove on a sunday early evening. Feel free to call it Gravy if you like.</p>

Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>4 <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/10/meatballs-recipe.html" title="Meatballs Recipe">Meatballs</a>, uncooked</li>
<li>3 Sweet Italian Sausage, uncooked</li>
<li>6 28oz. <a type="amzn">Cans of Whole, Peeled Plum Tomatoes</a>
</li>
<li>1 Medium Onion, diced</li>
<li>4-5 Cloves of Garlic, chopped</li>
<li>20-25 Leaves of Fresh Basil</li>
<li>3 Tbs Fresh Oregano</li>
<li>1 Tbs Kosher Salt</li>
<li>2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat a <a type="amzn">large sauce pot</a> over medium-high heat. When the pot is hot, add the olive oil and whatever meat you've decided to use. Brown the meat well on all sides. This will take several minutes - BE PATIENT - you're developing flavor here so take your time. </p>
<p>While the meat is browning, place your basil and oregano leaves in a <a type="amzn">blender</a> with one can of the tomatoes. Blend well (about 10 seconds) until the herb leaves are mixed completely into the tomatoes. </p>
<p>Once the meat is brown, add the onion, salt and pepper to the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, 5-7 minutes. As the onion releases it's liquid, scrape the bottom of the pot to get the browned bits of meat up. Add the garlic and cook another minute longer.</p>
<p>Add the blended tomato-herb mixture to the pot and give it a stir. Turn the heat up to High. </p>
<p>Now, working quickly, pour each can of tomatoes into the blender and pulse just once or twice to break up the tomatoes - just a couple seconds for each can - then add to the pot. After all six cans are in, stay close by. Each time the pot starts to boil, give it a stir and reduce the heat a bit. Repeat 3-4 times until the pot is at a low simmer and the heat has gradually be reduced to LOW. </p>
<p>Continue to simmer over low heat, stirring every 15-20 minutes, for at least three hours. Each time you stir, scrape down any deep red bits forming on the sides of the pot. I typically make a large batch of meatballs when I make the sauce. Some it brown in the pot as above, and the rest I cook mostly in the oven, and then let simmer in the sauce for the last two hours. </p>
<p>Sauce is done after it's reduced by about 20%. </p>
<p>This recipe makes quite a lot. It keeps in the fridge for 7-10 days, and can be frozen immediately for several weeks. </p>
