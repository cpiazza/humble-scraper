<p>Once again I need to give credit to The Drummer Boy for a recipe. He gave me this one over the phone one day and it's so unbelievably easy and delicious that I make one every time I whip up a batch of <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/12/pizza-dough-recipe.html">pizza dough</a>. </p>

		
			
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homemade Pizza Dough (use 1/2 of the dough resulting from this <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/12/pizza-dough-recipe.html">pizza dough recipe</a>)</li>
<li>1/4 Lb Slicing Pepperoni (ask the deli man to slice it thin, please)</li>
<li>1/4 Cup Grated Romano Cheese</li>
<li>3 Tbs Milk</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Freshly Grated Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degree.</p>
<p>Roll out the pizza dough into an oval shape about 1/8" thick. Leaving 3/4" around the edges, distribute the pepperoni evenly, fully covering the dough (except the 3/4" around the edge, of course). Sprinkle the cheese over the pepperoni then brush the edges with milk. </p>
<p>With the dough facing you length-wise roll it up like a jelly roll, keeping it tight. Having the pepperoni sliced thin really helps here. Transfer the roll to a baking dish and brush the top with milk. Apply the salt and pepper evenly across the top of the roll, then bake for 20 minutes. </p>
<p>Slice and serve hot or warm. </p>
