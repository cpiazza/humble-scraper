 </p>
<p>This year we're all heading over to my mom's house for Thanksgiving and, I have to admit, I miss the prep and planning that goes into pulling a holiday meal together. As such, I've been cooking some surrogate dishes to get me through my withdrawals. Last week I stuffed and roasted a chicken, and this week I was thinking about vegetables. </p>
<p>A few years ago I made Brussels Sprouts and Carrots in a sauce of butter, sage, and vermouth. I was going to make that again last night, but things got a little hectic and I needed a quick way out. I also had no vermouth in the house, so a hot oven and a <a type="amzn">cast iron skillet</a> would have to do. </p>

		
			<p><strong>
Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Pint of Brussels Sprouts</li>
<li>4 Carrots</li>
<li>4 Cloves of Garlic</li>
<li>6-7 Fresh Sage Leaves</li>
<li>Juice from 1 Clementine or 1/2 Orange</li>
<li>3 Tbs <a type="amzn">Extra Virgin Olive Oil</a>
</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prep:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees. </li>
<li>Trim the bottoms off your sprouts, remove any unsavory looking outer leaves, and cut each one in half. </li>
<li>Peel the carrots and cut into 3/4" pieces</li>
<li>Peel the garlic and cut each clove in half</li>
<li>Chop the fresh sage</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cook:</strong><br>    Combine all ingredients in a <a type="amzn">9" Cast Iron Skillet</a> and toss well so that all the sprouts and carrots are coated in the olive oil. Roast in the oven until tender, about 45 minutes</p>
