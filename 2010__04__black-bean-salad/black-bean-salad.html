<p>With summer getting closer it's time to brush up on some quick sides and salads that are versatile enough to serve with just about anything. This one came from my wife asking me to pick up a bean salad from the deli counter, but the line was just too long and, well, why not make it yourself?</p>

<li>1 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
