			<div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">This recipe was modified 
to remove the iconic red food coloring.  Many people do not know that 
food coloring is a known carcinogen.  Obviously, the adverse effects 
only arise after excessive consumption, but most processed foods have 
food coloring these days.  Originally, Red Velvet cakes did not contain food coloring, but rather utilized a lighter, 
alkaline cocoa that appears reddish-brown in certain light.  Around the 
1950's, the food industry began selling a darker, acidic cocoa, which 
spawned the classic Devil's Food cake recipes.  </div>

<div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">This recipe attempts
 to capture the classic, non-artificial taste and texture of the 
original Red Velvet cakes.  Most recipes use about 3 bottles of food coloring, which is a lot.  This recipe makes about 24 cupcakes<strong> </strong>
