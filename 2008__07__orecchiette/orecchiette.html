<p>For a while in the late 1990S I worked on West 19th Street in Manhattan. A few doors down from the office was a small, unassuming, Italian restaurant called Portfolio that was steady and reliable. For some reason, their preparation of <strong>Orecchiette</strong> with <strong>Broccoli Rabe</strong> and <strong>Sausage</strong> always gave me a warm cozy feeling inside. Italian comfort food, if you will. </p>

<p>Recently, I started working in the old neighborhood again and Portfolio's is <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/portfolio-restaurant-new-york#hrid:OPHxk5pNj8gcqW2Ezl7fBw/query:portfolio">still there</a>. I haven't been back to eat yet but I've been craving those little ears so I decided to make it myself. </p>
