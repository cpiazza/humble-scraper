<p>I came clean many years ago and admitted my addiction to <strong>sausage and peppers</strong>. Maybe it's the southern Italian in me, but when I lived in NY City I couldn't pass a street fair without stopping at one (of the several) sausage and peppers stands for a hero.</p>
<p>These days I don't get to the NYC street fairs so much any more, but I still get cravings - really they're more like flashbacks - for some fennel sausage and sweet peppers.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>- 9 Sweet Italian Sausages <br>- 3 Tbs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MMO8W2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwtinpig-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000MMO8W2" target="_blank" title="Good Olive Oil">Extra Virgin Olive Oil</a> <br>- 2 Bell Peppers (Red, Yellow, or Orange), cut into strips <br>- 3 Cubanelle or Vinegar Peppers, cut into strips <br>- 1/2 Onion (red or yellow), cut into strips <br>- 1 Clove of Garlic, diced <br>- 1/2 Cup Red Wine <br>- 2 Tbs Fresh Oregano, chopped</p>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RAAOKE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwtinpig-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000RAAOKE" target="_blank" title="Large Skillet">large skillet</a> over medium-high heat. Add the sausages and brown well on all sides (about 3 minutes per side). Remove the sausages from the pan, and toss in the garlic. Cook the garlic for about 30 seconds, then add the peppers and onions. Toss well and cook for 2 minutes, then add the wine.</p>
<p>Bring the wine to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer and return the sausages to the pan. Cover the pan and continue to simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove the cover and cook for 5 minutes longer to allow the sauce to reduce a bit. Add the fresh and oregano at the last minute and serve with good, crusty, bread.</p>
