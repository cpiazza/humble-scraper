<p>There are certain dishes I obsess over for a period of time, experimenting with recipe variations until I hit upon something I like. <strong>Chili</strong> was one of those obsessions for me, and it lasted longer than most. Seventeen years, to be exact.</p>
<p>In the end, the winning concoction came down to omitting what I've been assuming to be the foundation of the recipe. To achieve Chili-Nirvana, I've removed all tomatoes from my recipe. </p>
<p>NO TOMATOES. That's right, you heard me. None. I'm pretty sure this qualifies it, to some extent, as a <strong>texas-style chili</strong>, which relies on pepper pulp for the base. Either way, I'm quite happy with the results. </p>
