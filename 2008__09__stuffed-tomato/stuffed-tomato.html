<p>I'm always on the lookout for food items that might be conducive to being stuffed with sausage. When you think about it, what (savory) dish <em>wouldn't</em> be improved by adding a few links of italian sweet? So what matters most, then, is size and shape and when I saw a boxful of large, ripe, tomatoes at my local farm stand, I knew I was in business. </p>
