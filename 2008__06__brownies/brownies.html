<p>My youngest son said he wanted <strong>brownies</strong> for his birthday. </p>

<p>The only problem was that we'd already booked a party with loads of dinosaurs and, well, ice cream. Admittedly, we went a little over-board on this one. His actual birthday is in the middle of July - after school has let out for the summer and smack in the middle of our summer beach rental. So while his brother has been having parties with all his school friends in the middle of winter, he's had to make do with a couple beach friends and a cup cake. We knew he'd catch on eventually, and this year he did. </p>

<p>So we threw him his first "real" birthday party and despite the fact that we had vanilla ice cream on order, he wanted brownies. </p>
