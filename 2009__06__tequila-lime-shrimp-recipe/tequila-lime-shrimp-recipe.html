<p>In my younger years, a bottle of tequila might not hang around my kitchen for very long. But I've had this bottle of Jose Cuervo Gold sitting my my cupboard for a couple years now (longer?) and I figured it was time to do something with it. I couldn't really picture me and the wife lining up the shot glasses, what with the kids needing to be fed and all, so I inebriated some shrimp instead.</p>

		
			
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>12-18 Jumbo Shrimp - get them with the shells still on and peel and de-vein them yourself. 
</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Tequila 
</li>
<li>Juice from 1 Lime 
</li>
<li>1 Tbs Honey 
</li>
<li>1 Clove Garlic, chopped 
</li>
<li>2 Tbs Fresh Chopped Cilantro 
</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt 
</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper </li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the tequila, lime juice, honey, garlic, salt, pepper, and cilantro in a large mixing bowl. Whisk well to combine, then add the cleaned shrimp. </p>
<p>Marinate the shrimp for 15 minutes or so (not too long else the lime juice will start to cook the shrimp). Remove shrimp from the marinate and set aside. Transfer the liquid to a medium sauce pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. </p>
<p>While the shrimp is soaking, get your coals HOT. Grill the shrimp 2 minutes per side over direct-high heat. Drizzle about 1 Tsp of the reduced marinade over each side of each shrimp while they're cooking. </p>
<p>Serve with fresh lime wedges. </p>
