<p>Eric said to put bacon in my <strong>stuffed clams</strong>, but not to use cheese. I too his pork-advice, but left a small amount of cheese in there for good measure. So, in part, this is his recipe, too. </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Dozen Little Neck Clams</li>

<li>3 Strips of Bacon</li>

<li>2 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>

<li>1/4 Cup Yellow Onion, Diced</li>

<li>1/4 Cup Red Bell Pepper, Diced</li>

<li>2 Cloves of Garlic, Minced</li>

<li>1/2 Cup Unseasoned Bread Crumbs</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>

<li>1/8 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>

<li>1/4 Cup Fresh Parsley, Chopped</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350 Degrees.</p>

<p>Rinse and scrub your clams under cold water. Fill a large pot with with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Add the clams to the pot, cover, and reduce heat to medium-high. Simmer until all the clams have opened, about 10 minutes. Remove opened clams from the pot, but save the water. Discard any clams that don't open as they were likely dead before they hit the pot. </p>

<p>Remove the clams from the shells and chop well. Break the clam shells apart at the hinge and pick out 12 of the best looking specimens. Rinse them under cold water and set aside. </p>

<p>While the clams are steaming, heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Cut the bacon into large dice and saute until crisp. Remove bacon from the pan and set aside, leaving as much of the rendered fat behind. Add the butter to the pan and just when it's melted, add the onion and bell pepper. Saute, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute another minute. </p>

<p>Transfer the onion-pepper-garlic mixture to a large mixing bowl and add 1/2 Cup of the liquid left behind from the steamed clams. Mix well, then add the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, parsely, and chopped clams. Mix well. </p>

<p>Place each of the 12 clam shells onto a baking sheet and fill with a heaping tablespoon of the clam mixture. Sprinkle each with a bit of the grated cheese, then bake till golden brown - about 25 minutes. </p>
