<p>I'm going to do it. </p>

<p>Eventually, I'll get one of my kids to eat soup. I mean, other than the tomato "soup" they get a school. So I figure I'll just keep making it until one day they give in. Of course, I enjoy it so it's really no trouble. </p>

<p>Here's my latest effort.
</p>
		
			<p>
Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 lb Sweet Italian Sausage, removed from the casing</li>
<li>3 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1 Large Onion, cut into large dice</li>
<li>4 Carrots, diced</li>
<li>3 Celery Stalks, diced</li>
<li>1 Clove of Garlic, diced</li>
<li>1/2 Cup of White Wine</li>
<li>1 lb Dried Cannelini Beans</li>
<li>2 Quarts Chicken or <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/11/vegetable-stock-recipe.html">Vegetable Stock</a>
</li>
<li>1 Rind from a good sized piece of Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
<li>1 Large Sprig of Fresh Rosemary</li>
<li>1 Tbs Cider Vinegar</li>
<li>2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>The night before making the soup put your dried beans in a bowl, cover with cold water, cover the bowl and set to soak over night.</p>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a heavy soup pot of medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the sausage. Brown the sausage well on all sides (about 10 minutes), breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks. When the sausage is well browned, remove it from the pot using a slotted spoon and place in a bowl (don't lose it, you'll be adding it back to the soup shortly).</p>
<p>Add the onion to the pot (plus more olive oil, if needed), and saute until softened (5-6 minutes). Add the carrot, celery, and garlic - stir well and cook for another minute. Raise heat to high and add the white wine. Bring wine to a boil, scrapping any remaining brown bits off the bottom of the pot. </p>
<p>Drain your beans that have been soaking over night and add to the pot, along with the cheese rind, rosemary, cooked sausage, salt, pepper, and the stock. </p>
<p>Bring the whole thing a boil then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for one hour (stirring occasionally). After an hour, place about 1/4 of the soup in a blender (try to leave the sausage pieces out of the blender) and pulse till combined. Add back to the pot and mix well. </p>
<p>Stir in the cider vinegar at the last minute. Serve with fresh grated Parmesan and crusty bread. </p>
