<p>There was a time in my career when my career didn't take up nearly as much time as it does now. </p>
<p>In those days, the booming internet economy allowed me to work from home as an independent contractor, which in turn gave me all sorts of freedoms with my schedule. I would shop daily for the food I wanted to cook that night - bread from the bakery, meat from the butcher, and produce from the green grocer. It was nice. </p>
<p>Those days also allowed me to develop a <a type="amzn">Columbo</a> addiction. AMC used to show 1-2 episodes a day, and I would plan my work-load around the TV schedule. For those of you who are fans, you may recall one episode where the murderer is a restuarant owner. At the end, when the jig is up (as it always is), Columbo reveals his logic - and thus the culprit's downfall - as he prepares a veal scallopini dish for him. He alternates between explaining the recipe and the clues he uncovered, while the murderer marvels at both his detective and culinary work. </p>
<p>Those were the days. </p>
<p>So I don't quite remember how Columbo prepared that veal, and I'm not much of a slueth, but here's my take on <strong>Veal Scallopini</strong>. </p>
