<p>I finally made out to the local farmers market. I've been meaning to for some time but the weekends get so busy so fast that there's never time. So I went a little crazy when I got there, buying up everything I could get my hands on without really knowing how I was going to use it. </p>

<p>Among the bounty were HUGE bunches of Basil, Rosemary, and Thyme. At $2 each, I couldn't really pass them up. The basil went into a <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/pasta-salad.html">Pasta Salad</a> and I used a good portion of the Rosemary and Thyme on some <strong>Pork Loin</strong>. <br> </p>
