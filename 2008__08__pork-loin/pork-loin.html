<p>I finally made out to the local farmers market. I've been meaning to for some time but the weekends get so busy so fast that there's never time. So I went a little crazy when I got there, buying up everything I could get my hands on without really knowing how I was going to use it. </p>

<p>Among the bounty were HUGE bunches of Basil, Rosemary, and Thyme. At $2 each, I couldn't really pass them up. The basil went into a <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/pasta-salad.html">Pasta Salad</a> and I used a good portion of the Rosemary and Thyme on some <strong>Pork Loin</strong>. <br> </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>7-8 Fresh Rosemary Sprigs</li>

<li>7-8 Fresh Thyme Sprigs</li>

<li>3 Cloves of Garlic</li>

<li>Zest from 1 Orange</li>

<li>1/4 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>

<li>2-3 Lbs Pork Loin</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove the rosemary and thyme leaves from their respective stems. Add the leaves, garlic, orange zest, olive oil, salt, and pepper to a small food processor. Pulse until everything is we'll chopped. </p>

<p>Place the pork in a large bowl and rub the herb mixture into the pork, getting in all the nooks and crannies. Cover and refrigerate for about two hours. Remove from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 30 - 45 minutes before cooking. </p>

<p>Grill, covered, over indirect-medium heat (or cook in a pre-heated 325 degree oven) for about one hour. The internal temperature should come to 155 degrees when it's ready. </p>

<p>Remove from grill and let stand about 10 minute before slicing into it.</p>
