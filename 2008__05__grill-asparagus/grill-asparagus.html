<p>Grilling vegetables brings out a flavor you cannot achieve by steaming, boiling, or even oven roasting. I like to prepare <strong>Grilled Asparagus</strong> simply, and cook it directly over HOT coals very quickly. This keeps them crisp on the inside while you still get a nice char and flavor development on the outside. <br> </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Bunch of <strong>Asparagus</strong>
</li>

<li>1/4 Tsp Salt</li>

<li>1 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>1 Lemon</li>

<li>Black Pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>Drizzle Olive Oil over the asparagus, making sure each one is coated. Sprinkle salt over the top.</p>

<p>Get your coals good and hot. These cook very quickly and I usually save them for the last item to go on the grill. Place asparagus in a single layer directly over the hot coals. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. Wait about 30 seconds then, using a good set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGrips-12-Inch-Stainless-Steel-Locking-Tongs%2Fdp%2FB00004OCK1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dhome-garden%26qid%3D1211382965%26sr%3D8-2&amp;tag=humblerecipes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" rel="nofollow">tongs</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=humblerecipes-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;">, turn asparagus and cook on other side another 30 seconds. If you feel they're not quite done enough, you can now move them off to the site of the grill (indirect heat) and cook, covered, another couple of minutes. </p>

<p>When done, transfer asparagus to a serving plate. Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon over the top and season with extra salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with lemon wedges. </p>
