<p>Grilling vegetables brings out a flavor you cannot achieve by steaming, boiling, or even oven roasting. I like to prepare <strong>Grilled Asparagus</strong> simply, and cook it directly over HOT coals very quickly. This keeps them crisp on the inside while you still get a nice char and flavor development on the outside. <br> </p>
