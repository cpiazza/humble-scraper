<p><strong>Buffalo Chicken Wings</strong> seem to go hand in hand with autumn. Maybe it has something to do with football, or maybe <strong>buffalo wings</strong> just make for a nice transition from outdoor grilling to indoor cooking. Whatever the reason, the recipe is fairly simple, though I depart from the original by baking my wings instead of frying, and adding a couple ingredients to the sauce. </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3 Lbs of Chicken Wings</li>

<li>1 Cup White Flour</li>

<li>1 Tbs Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1 Tbs Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>

<li>1 Cup Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce</li>

<li>4 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>

<li>2 Tbs <a type="amzn">Worcestershire Sauce</a>
</li>

<li>1 Tbs Dried Oregano</li>

<li>1/4 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375 Degrees.</p>

<p>In a <a type="amzn">large mixing bowl</a>, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Place chicken wings in the bowl and toss in the flour until the wings are well coated. Place the wings on two largeÂ  baking sheets and bake in the oven until crisp and well done, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. </p>

<p>About 20 minutes before the wings are finished cooking, prepare the sauce. In a <a type="amzn">medium sauce pan</a>, melt the butter then add the hot sauce and mix well. Add remaining ingredients and heat to a low boil and bring to a low boil, stirring frequently. Simmer for 10 more minutes then remove from heat. </p>

<p>When wings are done (MAKE SURE THEY'RE CRISPY), remove from oven and transfer to a large bowl. Pour the sauce over the wings and mix well. </p>

<p>Serve with celery and carrot sticks and a side of blue cheese dressing. </p>
