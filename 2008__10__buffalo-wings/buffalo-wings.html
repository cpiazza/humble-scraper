<p><strong>Buffalo Chicken Wings</strong> seem to go hand in hand with autumn. Maybe it has something to do with football, or maybe <strong>buffalo wings</strong> just make for a nice transition from outdoor grilling to indoor cooking. Whatever the reason, the recipe is fairly simple, though I depart from the original by baking my wings instead of frying, and adding a couple ingredients to the sauce. </p>
