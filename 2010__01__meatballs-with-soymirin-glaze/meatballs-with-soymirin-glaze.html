<p>Well, let me clarify. The Big One is happy to try most things and has a broader palette (which mostly doesn't include vegetables), but the Little One has a diet whose entries you could count on one hand. </p>
<p>Wedged between the hot dogs and the chicken fingers are little meatballs that my wife get's from a local deli. He wants nothing to do with my <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/10/meatballs-recipe.html">Real Italian Meatballs</a>, which is a point of contention and the reason I'll be taking him out of my will unless he changes his ways, but I figured I could at least try to replicate the golf-ball-sized spheres of beef he drools over whenever my wife returns from town. I tried once without much success, then a co-worker gave me a recipe, which I've based these on.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure those deli meatballs use some kinds of canned beef gravy and I'm absolutely sure these are much better. As it turns out, the Little One thinks so, too.</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 lb Ground Veal</li>
<li>1/3 lb Ground Pork</li>
<li>1 1/3 lb Ground Beef</li>
<li>1 Egg</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Parmesan Cheese</li>
<li>1/3 Cup Bread Crumbs</li>
<li>1 Shallot, minced</li>
<li>2 Cloves Garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Soy Sauce</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Mirin</li>
<li>1/4 Cup Sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the veal, pork, beef, egg, cheese, bread crumbs, shallot, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Cover and let stand for about an hour.</p>
<p>Pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees. Form the meatballs to be about the size of a golf ball. Place them on a baking sheet (or two), leaving space between them, and bake for 20 minutes. </p>
<p>While they're baking, make the glaze. Combine the Soy, Mirin, and Sugar in a sauce pot. Whisk over high heat until it just comes to a boil, then reduce heat a simmer for 5 minutes more. Remove from heat. </p>
<p>After the meatballs have cooked for 20 minutes, transfer them to a 13x9 baking pan. Pour the soy mixture over the meatballs, and turn them all to coat. </p>
<p>Raise the heat of the oven to 400 degrees and return the meatballs, now in the glaze mixture, to the over for another 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Remove from oven and serve hot.</p>
