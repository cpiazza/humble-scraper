<p>So I refuse to make <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/chicken-cutlets.html">chicken fingers</a> every night but my youngest son has convinced himself that the only type of food he eats is chicken. That's fine, I guess, as it keeps me experimenting with different <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/chicken/index.html">chicken recipes</a>. This one is great for the grill, and be sure to make extra. I like to slice up the leftovers to make chicken quesadillas. </p>
