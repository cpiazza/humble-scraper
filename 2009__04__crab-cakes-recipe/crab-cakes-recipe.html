<p>My older son has turned into a fairly adventurous eater. That is, at least he's willing to try new things even if the result is a resounding "bleccchh!" and a rush to get a glass of water. When we do find something he likes I try to work it into the regular rounds of home cooking and have had <strong>Crab Cakes</strong> on the list things to try at home for some time. </p>
<p>So these were my first attempt and I basically winged it. I'm pretty happy with how they turned out and the fact that there was just one of the nine crab cakes left makes me think the boy was pretty happy, too.</p>

Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 oz of <a type="amzn">Lump Crab meat</a> (liquid drained)</li>
<li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>1/2 Cup yellow onion, diced</li>
<li>1/4 Cup celery, diced</li>
<li>1/4 Cup red bell pepper, diced</li>
<li>1 Clove of Garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 Cup Frozen corn (about 1/2 a package)</li>
<li>1 Cup bread crumbs</li>
<li>1 Egg, beaten</li>
<li>1/4 Cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
<li>2 Tsp ground coriander</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp fresh ground black pepper</li>
<li>Lemons for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p>Over medium-high heat, warm 2 Tbs of olive oil in a heavy skillet (I used my <a type="amzn">lodge cast iron skillet</a>). When the oil is hot, add the onion and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add the celery and bell pepper to the pan and cook for 3 minutes longer, then add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Now add the frozen corn to the pan, stir well, and turn the heat up to high. Cook until the corn just barely starts to brown on the outside (about 5 minutes). </p>
<p>Transfer all ingredients from the skillet to a large mixing bowl. Wipe the inside skillet with a dish towel and set aside.</p>
<p>To the mixing bowl, add the remaining ingredients and mix well with your hands. Form the mixture into crab cakes using about 3/4 Cup for each cake. </p>
<p>Return the skillet to stove top, place over medium-high heat, and add 1/2 Cup of olive oil. When the oil is hot and begins to shimmer, start adding your crab cakes. Cook four cakes at a time till golden on both sides (5-7 minutes per side). </p>
<p>Serve with lemon wedges. </p>
