<p>My older son has turned into a fairly adventurous eater. That is, at least he's willing to try new things even if the result is a resounding "bleccchh!" and a rush to get a glass of water. When we do find something he likes I try to work it into the regular rounds of home cooking and have had <strong>Crab Cakes</strong> on the list things to try at home for some time. </p>
<p>So these were my first attempt and I basically winged it. I'm pretty happy with how they turned out and the fact that there was just one of the nine crab cakes left makes me think the boy was pretty happy, too.</p>
