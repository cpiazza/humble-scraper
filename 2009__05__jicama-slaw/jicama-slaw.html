<p>The last time I wanted to make a Jicama Slaw, my grocery let me down and I ended up with a <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/mango-slaw.html">Mango Cabbage Slaw</a> instead. It was good, but it wasn't what I was after. Well, it's a year later and I finally spotted some Jicama in the produce aisle. </p>
