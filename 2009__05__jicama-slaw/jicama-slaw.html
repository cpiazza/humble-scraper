<p>The last time I wanted to make a Jicama Slaw, my grocery let me down and I ended up with a <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/mango-slaw.html">Mango Cabbage Slaw</a> instead. It was good, but it wasn't what I was after. Well, it's a year later and I finally spotted some Jicama in the produce aisle. </p>

Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Medium Sized Jicama</li>
<li>3 Radishes</li>
<li>1 Carrot</li>
<li>2 Navel Oranges</li>
<li>Juice from 1 1/2 limes</li>
<li>1 Tbs Fresh Ginger</li>
<li>2 Tbs Sesame Oil</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1/4 Cup Fresh Cilantro, chopped</li>
</ul>
<p>
There's a fair amount of prep that goes into this dish. First, you need to peel the jicama and the carrot. Then you'll need to shred both of those, along with the radishes. The best tool for this job is a <a type="amzn">mandolin slicer</a>, which will make quick work of all three. </p>
<p>Place the shredded carrot, jicama, and radish into a large mixing bowl. Now, remove the sections from your oranges and place into the bowl. Sectioning an orange is accomplished by running your chef's knife down the sides of the orange, removing all the pith, then carefully slicing the sections out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_CxxTnOyJw">There's a handy video</a> (courtesy of Cooking.com) posted on YouTube that gives a nice demonstration of how to do this. </p>
<p>Place the ginger, sesame oil, salt, and lime juice into a small food processor. Pulse until well combined. Pour over the ingredients in your mixing bowl, add the chopped cilantro, and mix well. Refrigerate at least one hour before serving. </p>
