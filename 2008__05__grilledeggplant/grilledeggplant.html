We spent the first half of the trip in Venice and Florence, eating great food and getting our fill of culture. I think she's still a little angry at me for the hotel selection I made in Florence, but that's a subject for another story. </p>

<p>For the second half of our trip, we rented a car and toured the hill towns of Tuscany and Umbria. The uncontested culinary winner of this portion of the trip was <a href="http://www.anticafattoriadelcolle.it/eng/homeNEW.htm">Antica Fattoria Del Colle</a> an inn / farmhouse we stayed at in Deruta. Dinner was served "family style" each evening, with the guests from the 10 guest rooms seated around a large wooden table. Every 15 minutes or so, the chef / owner would enter the room carrying a dish prepared with ingredients freshly picked, plucked, or, um, killed on his farm. With each entry he would provide the history of the dish, some local anecdote, and occasionally the name of the livestock who had recently made the supreme sacrifice ("Luna" the cow sticks in my mind). </p>

<p>This <strong>grilled eggplant</strong> dish is simple and relies on fresh ingredients, like all the meals we had on that trip. Be sure to use fresh mint in this as the dried doesn't bring the same flavor to the dish. </p>
