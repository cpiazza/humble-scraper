<li>2 cups stone ground wheat flour</li>
<li>1 tsp baking soda </li>
<li>1 tsp baking powder </li>
<li>1 tsp salt </li>
<li>1 tsp cinnamon </li>
<li>4 Tbsp butter (room temp.) </li>
<li>1 cup pumpkin purée </li>
<li>2/3 cup brown sugar </li>
<li>2/3 cup white sugar </li>
<li>2 large egg </li>
<li>2 tsp vanilla extract </li>
<li>3 cups rolled oats </li>
<li>1 cup dried cranberries </li>
<li>1 bag of white chips</li>
<li>1 cup toasted almonds (optional)</li>
<li>1/2 cup diced crystalized ginger (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, stir together the stone ground wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon until very well combined.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, beat together the butter (room temperature), pumpkin, brown sugar, and white sugar on low speed.</li>
<ol>
<li>Once they’re well combined, add the egg and vanilla and beat until well combined again.</li>
<li>Add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture and beat on low speed just until a thick, creamy batter forms.</li>
<li>Add the dry oats and dried cranberries, almonds (if desired) and ginger (if desired) and stir them into the batter with a spoon.</li>
</ol>
<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or use non-stick cooking spray</li>
<ol>
<li>Spoon the batter onto the baking sheet in 2 Tbsp portions, leaving about 1.5 inches between each cookie.</li>
<li>The cookies will not spread much during baking, so gently pat them down into flattened circles.</li>
</ol>
<li>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 16-18 minutes, or until slightly browned on the surface. Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack before eating.</li>
</ol>
