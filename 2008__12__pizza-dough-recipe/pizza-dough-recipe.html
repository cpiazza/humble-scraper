<p>The Drummer Boy posted his world famous <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/10/pizza.html">homemade pizza recipe</a> a while back, and in it he included his <strong>pizza dough recipe</strong> as well. I've cribbed his process for making pizza dough and use it so often I felt it deserved its own post. </p>
<p>The ingredients I've listed call for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RLW0GY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwtinpig-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000RLW0GY">Double-0 ("00") Flour</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpwwwtinpig-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000RLW0GY" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1">. Double-0 is more finely milled and bakes up a bit crispier - but it can also be hard to find. If you can't locate it, standard white flour will do. </p>
