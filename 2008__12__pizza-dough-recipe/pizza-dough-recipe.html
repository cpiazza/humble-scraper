<p>The Drummer Boy posted his world famous <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/10/pizza.html">homemade pizza recipe</a> a while back, and in it he included his <strong>pizza dough recipe</strong> as well. I've cribbed his process for making pizza dough and use it so often I felt it deserved its own post. </p>
<p>The ingredients I've listed call for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RLW0GY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwtinpig-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000RLW0GY">Double-0 ("00") Flour</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpwwwtinpig-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000RLW0GY" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1">. Double-0 is more finely milled and bakes up a bit crispier - but it can also be hard to find. If you can't locate it, standard white flour will do. </p>

		
			<p>
Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>3 Cups Double-0 ("00") or All-Purpose White Flour</li>
<li>1 Package Active Dry Yeast</li>
<li>1 Cup Warm Water</li>
<li>1 Tbs Honey</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>2 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the water, yeast, and water in a small bowl and mix well. Let stand a few minutes to allow the yeast to bloom. Transfer the water-yeast-honey mixture to the mixing bowl of a <a type="amzn">stand mixer</a> fitted with a <a type="amzn">dough hook</a>. With the mixer set to the lowest possible speed, add the olive oil and salt and then the flour one cup at a time. You'll likely need to stop the mixture and scrape down the bowl after all the flour is added. Continue mixing until all ingredients are well combined and the dough begins to climb up the hook. </p>
<p>Transfer the dough to a well floured surface and kneed by hand for 2-3 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and coat lightly with Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Place in a bowl and cover with a damp towel. Set in a cool place to rise for 3 hours. </p>
<p>After three hours, return the dough to your floured surface. Divide it into 2 equal pieces. With each piece, shape again into a ball by tucking the sides under the bottom several times. Oil each piece, place in separate bowls, cover again with damp towels, and allow to rise for another hour. </p>
<p>At this point, it's best to use the dough immediately for whatever you had planned. Otherwise, it can be refrigerated for a couple hours before use. </p>
