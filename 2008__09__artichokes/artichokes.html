<p>One of the great things about keeping this site going is that it forces me to experiment. </p>

<p>It's so easy to get stuck combining the same ingredients in the same manner over and over. I've made stuffed artichokes so many times that I wanted to try something different with them this time.I had some pine nuts left over from the last time I made <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/09/pesto-recipe.html">Pesto</a> and it struck me that fennel would be a good companion to braised artichokes. Anyway, this is what I came up with. </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 Artichokes</li>

<li>3 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>1 Fennel Bulb, cut length-wise into long pieces</li>

<li>1 Clove of Garlic, chopped</li>

<li>1 Cup of White Wine</li>

<li>Juice from 1/2 of a Lemon</li>

<li>12-15 Fresh Mint Leaves, chopped</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1/4 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Fill a large bowl with ice water and squeeze half a lemon into the bowl. Prepare the artichokes as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the stem is still attached, cut off the bottom 1/4 inch. Then, using a vegetable peeler, peel away the fibrous outer layer of the stem.</li>

<li>Using a paring knife or a kitchen scissors, cut off the tough outer leaves of the artichoke. These are the darkest green leaves with the sharp points. </li>

<li>Cut the artichoke in half, length-wise</li>

<li>Using a spoon or a paring knife, remove the purple inner leaves and the fine strands that make up the choke. </li>

<li>Place artichokes in the bowl of ice water as you finish them (this will help keep them from turning brown.</li>
</ol>

<p>Head a large, deep, skillet over medium-high heat. Then the pan is just about hot, remove the artichokes from the water and pat dry. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to coat the pan, then place the artichokes in the pan, cut side down. Leave them there without moving them for 5-7 minutes, until they develop some nice brown color. </p>

<p>Remove the artichokes from the pan and set aside. Add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan along with the chopped fennel, salt, and pepper. Saute the fennel for 5 minutes, then add the garlic and cook another 30 seconds. Add the wine to the pan and turn the heat up to High. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</p>

<p>Return the artichokes to the pan, cut side up, and cover the pan. Simmer for 25 minutes, then remove the artichokes and place on a serving dish. Turn the heat to high once more and add the lemon juice. Cook for 2 more minutes, add the mint, stir, then pour the contents of the pan over the artichokes. </p>

<p>Top with pine nuts that have been salted and toasted in a 375 degree oven for 5 minutes (be sure not forget about them - the burn fast). </p>
