<p>One of the great things about keeping this site going is that it forces me to experiment. </p>

<p>It's so easy to get stuck combining the same ingredients in the same manner over and over. I've made stuffed artichokes so many times that I wanted to try something different with them this time.I had some pine nuts left over from the last time I made <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/09/pesto-recipe.html">Pesto</a> and it struck me that fennel would be a good companion to braised artichokes. Anyway, this is what I came up with. </p>
