<p>Many people have a story of their grandmother's <strong>chicken soup</strong> that would simmer for 12 days before it could be served. While I hold true to certain cooking traditions, sometimes I want a soup that can be eaten the same day I begin preparing it. </p>
<p>Nothing against your grandmother, but this is a full-flavored chicken soup that comes together fairly quickly and is hearty enough to be a full meal. I find that if you start with a good stock, the soup nearly makes itself. As with most things, I've used my <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/11/vegetable-stock-recipe.html">homemade vegetable stock</a> in this recipe, but feel free to substitute with your favorite chicken / veggie stock.</p>
