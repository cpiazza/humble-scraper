			<p>I use <strong>roasted peppers</strong> in a lot of my recipes. Many times I'll replace tomatoes in a recipe with roasted peppers, or use them to add sweetness to a dish. Normally I stick with Red, Yellow, and Orange Bell Peppers, but the method described below works well for any type of pepper. If you're roasting peppers with thinner flesh, be sure to watch them carefully or they'll roast away to nothingness. </p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/chili-recipe.html">Texas Style Chili</a>, <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/salsa.html">Salsa</a>, and <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/barbecue-sauce.html">Barbecue Sauce</a> all make heavy use of roasted peppers so instead of describing the method in each of those recipes I figured I'd make a separate post. They're also great on an antipasto plate with a little roasted garlic mixed in. <br> </p>
