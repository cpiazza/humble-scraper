Normally I stick with Red, Yellow, and Orange Bell Peppers, but the method described below works well for any type of pepper. If you're roasting peppers with thinner flesh, be sure to watch them carefully or they'll roast away to nothingness. </p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/chili-recipe.html">Texas Style Chili</a>, <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/salsa.html">Salsa</a>, and <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/barbecue-sauce.html">Barbecue Sauce</a> all make heavy use of roasted peppers so instead of describing the method in each of those recipes I figured I'd make a separate post. They're also great on an antipasto plate with a little roasted garlic mixed in. <br> </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any combination of Bell Peppers. I recommend not using Green Bell Peppers as the flavor isn't as pronounced as the red, yellow, or orange. </li>

<li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Peppers can be roasted ahead of time for any recipe and stored, covered in olive oil, in an air tight container for up to a week. There are a few methods for roasting peppers,
but you'll need a direct source of extreme high heat. This can be found
under your oven broiler, directly over the hot coals on your grill, or
waved over your gas stove top while pinched at the end of a pair of tongs<a id="KonaLink7" target="_top" class="kLink" href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/salsa.html#" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #640000;"></span></a>.
I'm going to describe the broiler method simply because it's the most year-round friendly procedure. </p>

<p>Set your oven to broil and keep the door closed to let the oven heat up a bit. While that's happening, halve your peppers length-wise and remove the stem and seeds. Coat the skin side of each pepper with a thin layer of extra virgin olive oil and place skin-side up on a cookie sheet. </p>

<p>Roast peppers about three inches from the heat source with the oven door closed. Watch them closely and roast until the skin is black and brittle. When the peppers have blackened, place them immediately in an air
tight container and seal for 10-15 minutes. This will allow them to
steam and the skin will separate from the flesh making them easier to
peel - which you'll need to do before serving or including in any recipe. </p>
