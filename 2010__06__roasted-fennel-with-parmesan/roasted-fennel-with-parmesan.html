Mostly, I eat it raw - on its own or in a salad. I've put it in soups from time to time, but I also like to roast it. Fennel, like other vegetables when they're roasted, will caramelize and develop a subtle sweetness. The fennel here is roasted simply and the saltiness of the Parmesan cheese compliments it nicely. </p>

Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 (or more) Fennel Bulbs</li>
<li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>Fresh Parmesan cheese, perferably Parmigiano Reggiano (not grated).</li>
<li>Kosher Salt</li>
<li>Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees. </p>
<p>Slice the fennel length-wise, such that the root end holds together the pear shaped slices. Slices should 1/4 = 1/2 inch thick. Coat fennel slices with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place fennel slices on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 20 minutes. </p>
<p>While the fennel is roasting, slice THIN pieces off your Parmesan wedge. After the fennel has cooked for 20 minutes, layer Parmesan slices on top of each fennel piece, then back in the oven for 10 minutes longer. </p>
<p>Serve hot.</p>
