			<p>I'm an idiot.</p>
<p>It's that simple. I fully intended to post this <strong>baby back ribs</strong> recipe and take some nice pictures to go along with it but in the rush of my father's day gathering, I simply forgot. And by the time I remembered those two lonely stalks you see above were all that remained of four gorgeous racks of ribs. I'll update the photo next time I make them... Of course, now I have an excuse.</p>
