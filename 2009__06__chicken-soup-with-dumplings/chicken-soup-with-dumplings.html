<br><div>My mom used to make this soup - it is very easy, and delicious...my kids even love it.    I usually start by making a roasted chicken dinner one night for dinner (I am sure Tin Pig has a roasted chicken recipe here somewhere), and then making a stock with the leftover carcass.   Just put the leftover chicken carcass in a large stock pot, cover with water, and boil, slightly covered, for approx 2 hours. I then let it cool, and refrigerate.   The next day, you can skim off any fat solids, remove the chicken bones, and leave any of the meat in the stock.    This is the base for the soup.  It makes approx 3 quarts.</div>
<br><div>Soup:</div>
<div>3 quarts (give or take) Chicken Stock with chicken pieces (see above for recipe)</div>
<div>1 cup Chopped carrots</div>
<div>1+1/2 tsp salt</div>
<div>Fresh Parsley</div>
<br><div>Dumplings:</div>
<div>1 cup unbleached flour</div>
<div>1 + 1/2 tsp baking powder</div>
<div>1 tsp salt</div>
<div>2 tbsp butter</div>
<div>1/2 cup milk</div>
<br><div>Mix Soup ingredients above, and bring to medium-low boil.    In separate bowl, mix flour, baking powder, salt together.   Add butter, and mix it in with a fork.   Add milk all at once, and stir quickly, and as little as possible, until everything is moistened.   Drop rounded spoonfuls of dumpling dough onto the boiling soup.   Let simmer for 10 minutes uncovered, then cover, and let simmer for another 10 minutes. Enjoy.</div>
