<p>I wanted <strong>Corn Bread</strong>. Not Corn Cake. Not a Corn Muffin. And I wanted it to be made mostly from Corn Meal, with little or no white flour.  </p>

<p>And so I set out to make something that was rustic and basic, that I could use a vehicle for Jalapeños or Cheddar or Pepper Jack or even whole kernels of corn. I've made a few batches and settled on this recipe. So far I've made it as written below, eaten alongside <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/soups/" title="Soup Recipes">soup</a> mostly. Grilling Season is coming up fast and I'm looking forward to some variations to compliment some <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/baby-back-ribs.html" title="Baby Back Ribs Recipe">ribs</a> or pulled pork. </p>
