<p>I wanted <strong>Corn Bread</strong>. Not Corn Cake. Not a Corn Muffin. And I wanted it to be made mostly from Corn Meal, with little or no white flour.  </p>

<p>And so I set out to make something that was rustic and basic, that I could use a vehicle for Jalapeños or Cheddar or Pepper Jack or even whole kernels of corn. I've made a few batches and settled on this recipe. So far I've made it as written below, eaten alongside <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/soups/" title="Soup Recipes">soup</a> mostly. Grilling Season is coming up fast and I'm looking forward to some variations to compliment some <a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/baby-back-ribs.html" title="Baby Back Ribs Recipe">ribs</a> or pulled pork. </p>

			<br>Ingredients:<br><ul>
<li>2 Cups of Corn Meal</li>
<li>1/4 Cup Oatmeal (whole oats)</li>
<li>2 Tsp Baking Powder</li>
<li>1 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>2 Cups Buttermilk</li>
<li>2 Eggs, beaten</li>
<li>3 Tbs Honey</li>
<li>2 Tbs Vegetable Shortening</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-heat a cast iron skillet in a 400 degree oven.</p>
<p>Heat a medium sauce pan over medium-high heat and add the oats. Toast the oats in the pan, stirring frequently, until they just begin to brown. You'll start to smell them when they're ready - about 5 minutes total. </p>
<p>Place the toasted oats in a mini food processor or spice mill, and grind until fine.</p>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the corn meal, oats, baking powder, and salt. </p>
<p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs into the buttermilk. Mix in the honey, then add to the dry ingredients. Mix by hand until well combined. </p>
<p>Add the shortening to the now VERY HOT (careful, please) cast iron skillet. Be sure to coat the bottom and sides with the shortening. Pour in the batter and bake at 400 degrees until golden, 25-35 minutes. </p>
