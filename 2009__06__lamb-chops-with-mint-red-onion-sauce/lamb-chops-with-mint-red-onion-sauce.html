<p>The mint is growing nicely in the box that rests on my deck rail. I've wanted a proper garden for some time now but there's simply too many trees surrounding my property to make it work. So I settle for a few herbs in flower boxes. The mint came in handy the day I spied some <strong>lamb chops</strong> under the cellophane at my local A&amp;P. I can't always make it to the town butcher, and these looked fresh, so I figured I'd give them a try.</p>
