<p>The mint is growing nicely in the box that rests on my deck rail. I've wanted a proper garden for some time now but there's simply too many trees surrounding my property to make it work. So I settle for a few herbs in flower boxes. The mint came in handy the day I spied some <strong>lamb chops</strong> under the cellophane at my local A&amp;P. I can't always make it to the town butcher, and these looked fresh, so I figured I'd give them a try.</p>

		
			
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 Lamb Chops</li>
<li>2 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
<li>1 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
<li>1 Cup Fresh Mint Leave</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Red Onion, chopped</li>
<li>Juice from 1/2 of a Lemon</li>
<li>2 Tbs Red Wine Vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>Let the lamb chops come to room temperature before cooking.</p>
<p>Get a section of your grill HOT (with hardwood charcoal, preferably). Salt and Pepper the chops using half the amount listed above. Coat with the olive oil and place on your grill over direct-high heat. </p>
<p>Grill the chops 6-7 minutes per side, then remove from the grill to let them rest (for about 8 minutes).</p>
<p>While the chops are resting, place the remaining ingredients in a small food processor and pulse until well combined. Drizzle the sauce over the chops before serving.</p>
