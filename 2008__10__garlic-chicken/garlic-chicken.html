<p>As I'm sure most parents will agree the weekends seem to fill up so quickly with chores and child-focused activities (multiple soccer games, birthday parties, etc.) that sometimes there's simply not enough time for yourself. For me that means not having time to cook what I was hoping to, and on those occasions I need a good, quick, standby that doesn't require too much prep time.Â  </p>

<p>This <strong>rosemary garlic chicken</strong> recipe is so easy, the hardest part is preheating your oven. The kids love it and you end up with some nice roasted garlic cloves when it's all done.</p>
