<p>Make your own. That's my motto, usually. The deli counter is full of prepared salads and while it's certainly easier to just buy some side salads to go with your summer meal, it's much more satisfying (and cost effective) to prepare it at home.I don't use <strong>feta</strong> cheese much, but its saltiness goes nicely with the mild <strong>cucumbers</strong> and <strong>tomatoes</strong>. </p>
