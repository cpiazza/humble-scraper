<p>Make your own. That's my motto, usually. The deli counter is full of prepared salads and while it's certainly easier to just buy some side salads to go with your summer meal, it's much more satisfying (and cost effective) to prepare it at home.I don't use <strong>feta</strong> cheese much, but its saltiness goes nicely with the mild <strong>cucumbers</strong> and <strong>tomatoes</strong>. </p>
		
			<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Cucumber</li>

<li>2 Medium Tomatoes</li>

<li>1/2 Medium Red Onion</li>

<li>3/4 Cup Crumbled Feta Cheese</li>

<li>1/2 Cup Fresh Chopped Oregano</li>

<li>2 Tbs Red Wine Vinegar</li>

<li>2 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel cucumber as much or as little as you wish. I like to peel about half of it, alternating peeled and unpeeled portions with my vegetable peeler. Cut cucumber in half lengthwise, then slice into half circles, about 1/4 inch thick. </p>

<p>Halve the tomatoes and remove the seeds. Cut into rough, large, dice. Slice onion into thin slivers. Combine onion, tomato, cucumber, and feta cheese in a large mixing bowl. Add oil, vinegar, and oregano and mix lightly. </p>

<p>Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. </p>
