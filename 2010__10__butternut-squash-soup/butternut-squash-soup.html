<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Mid-October already. Too many hobbies, I suppose. But, fall is here and it was time for some soup. Last weekend I roasted an Acorn Squash on the weber with a bit of maple and nutmeg and it put me in the mood for this soup. </p>

		
			
Ingredients:
<ul>
<li>1 Butternut Squash (2 1/2 lbs or so), peeled and cut into large dice</li>
<li>2 Carrots, peeled and cut into large dice</li>
<li>1/4 lb Pancetta, diced</li>
<li>1 Leek, washed and diced</li>
<li>1 stalk of Celery, diced</li>
<li>1 Clove of Garlic, minced</li>
<li>2 1/2 Quarts stock (chicken or veggie)</li>
<li>1 Tbs Maple Syrup</li>
<li>1 Tbs Cider Vinegar</li>
<li>2Tbs Fresh Sage, chopped</li>
<li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
<li>Kosher Salt</li>
<li>Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees.</p>
<p>In a large roasting pan, toss the squash and carrots with 2 Tbs Olive Oil, 1 Tsp Salt and 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper. Roast in the oven for 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Heat a large, heavy, stock pot over medium high heat. Add the Pancetta and cook until crisp - stirring frequently - about 8 minutes. Remove the Pancetta from the pot, leaving behind the rendered fat, and add 1 Tbs Olive Oil along with the Leeks, Celery, 1Tsp Salt and 1 Tsp Pepper. Cook until vegetable are soft, 8-10 minutes. Add the Garlic, stir, and cook for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Transfer the roasted Squash and Carrots to the stock pot. Add the Stock and Maple Syrup and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Using an immersion or counter top blender, blend the soup until smooth. Add the Cider Vinegar and Sage just before serving, and top each serving with a few pieces of the crisp Pancetta. </p>
