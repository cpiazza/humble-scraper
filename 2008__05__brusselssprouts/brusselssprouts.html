<p>Many people have an aversion to <strong>Brussels Sprouts</strong> that I've never quite understood. Perhaps they harbor a resentment left brewing by some overcooked tiny cabbages from their childhood. Who knows. Nevertheless, I love 'em and this recipe develops their flavor through roasting and adds a little sweetness to balance natural bitterness in the sprouts. <br> </p>
