<p>Many people have an aversion to <strong>Brussels Sprouts</strong> that I've never quite understood. Perhaps they harbor a resentment left brewing by some overcooked tiny cabbages from their childhood. Who knows. Nevertheless, I love 'em and this recipe develops their flavor through roasting and adds a little sweetness to balance natural bitterness in the sprouts. <br> </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2 little bushels of <strong>Brussels Sprouts</strong> (about 30-35 sprouts)</li>

<li>3 Cloves of Garlic, smashed with the back of your knife</li>

<li>3 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

<li>1 Tbs Light Brown Sugar</li>

<li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>

<li>1/4 Tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</p>

<p>In an oven proof, covered, casserole, combine all ingredients and mix thoroughly so that the Brussels Sprouts are well coated. Roast, covered, until sprouts are just tender (about 40 minutes). </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These can also be done on an outdoor grill, and then I guess you could call them <strong>Grilled Brussels Sprouts</strong>. Instead of using a covered casserole, make a packet out of tin foil and seal well. Roast the sprouts over indirect heat, with the grill covered, for the same amount of time. </p>
