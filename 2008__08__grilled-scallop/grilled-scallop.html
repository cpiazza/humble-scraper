<p>I recently changed jobs. On my last day at my old job a co-worker asked me for a <strong>scallop recipe</strong>. We'd been eating lunch at a fantastic little place on west 19th street that served Japanese style chicken wings and it occurred to me that the sweet soy-based sauce they used on the wings would do well for some fresh sea scallops. </p>
		
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>8-10 Sea Scallops</li>

<li>1/4 Cup Good Soy Sauce</li>

<li>1 Tbs Sesame Oil</li>

<li>1 Tbs Honey</li>

<li>1 Tbs Rice Wine Vinegar</li>

<li>2 Tsp Fresh Ginger, minced</li>
</ul>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine soy, sesame oil, honey, vinegar, and ginger. Add in the scallops and toss well so that they're coated with the soy mixture. Let stand for 15-20 minutes. </p>

<p>Remove scallops from marinade and pour remaining marinade into a small sauce pot. Bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce heat to low. Simmer until mixture has reduced by half. </p>

<p>Grill scallops over direct-high heat, about two minutes per side. Serve with reduced marinade drizzled on top. </p>
