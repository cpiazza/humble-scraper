<p>I recently changed jobs. On my last day at my old job a co-worker asked me for a <strong>scallop recipe</strong>. We'd been eating lunch at a fantastic little place on west 19th street that served Japanese style chicken wings and it occurred to me that the sweet soy-based sauce they used on the wings would do well for some fresh sea scallops. </p>
