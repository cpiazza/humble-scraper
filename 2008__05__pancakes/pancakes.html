<p>My two sons are great helpers in the kitchen and our new weekend morning tradition is making pancakes. We're not fans of the pre-packaged just-add-water pancake mixes in our house. If we wanted the pancakes made for us, we'd go to a diner. </p>

<p><u><strong>Ingredients</strong></u><br>1/2 Cup Whole Wheat Flour<br>1/2 Cup White Flour<br>1 Tsp Baking Powder<br>2 Tablespoons Light Brown Sugar<br>Pinch of Salt<br>1 Egg<br>1 Cup of Milk<br>1/2 Tsp Vanilla<br>Pre-heat a stove top griddle over a low flame. </p>

<p>Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Make sure there are no lumps (especially the brown sugar). Make a well in dry mixture and crack your egg into the middle. Beat the egg slightly, then add the milk. Stir slowly at first so as not to make gigantic mess (something I have to remind my helpers of constantly). When everything is well combined and smooth, stir in the vanilla. </p>

<p>Melt a pat of butter on the griddle and ladle about 1/2 cup of the batter for each pancake. Increase the heat to medium-low and cook the pancakes until there are lots of bubbles appearing on the top. You can check the underside a few times, too, looking for a nice golden brown. </p>

<p>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 30-60 seconds. Again, check the bottom a few times to make sure they're not burning. If needed, reduce the heat to low after the flip. This will help insure they cook through without getting too dark. </p>

<p>Serve with a pat of butter and some warmed up maple syrup. </p>

<p>Yield: 4-5 Pancakes.</p>

<p><strong>Options:</strong> <br>Here are some variations we've tried over the years - once you have the basic batter, it's great to experiment now and then.</p>

<p>1. If you're not crazy about whole wheat flour, you can use 1 full cup of white flour.<br>2. Add 1/4 - 1/2 Cup of oatmeal. You can grind it up in a food processor first to make sort of an oatmeal flour, or leave the oat whole. You'll need to add about 1/4 more milk to get the consistency right. <br>3. Add fruit and / or nuts. We like the oatmeal variation with banana's, but walnuts, blueberries and apples are all great additions, too.</p>
