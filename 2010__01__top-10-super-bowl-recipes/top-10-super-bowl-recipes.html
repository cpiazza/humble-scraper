There are the classics, of course, and the misadventures (usually in the form of a seven-layer-bean-dip) - but good food always makes a good party. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
		
			
<p style="text-align: left;">So in the spirit of over indulgence, heartburn, one-beer-too-many, and in no particular order I present to you the top 10 dishes I would prepare if I were having a party (or would love to be served should I find myself a guest for this year's spectacle).</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/10/buffalo-wings.html"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Buffalo Chicken Wings</span></strong></a> - Is there any more classic sporting event finger food? Probably not..</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mangiodasola.com/2010/01/mozzarella-sticks-wmarinara-sauce.html"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Mozzarella Sticks</span></strong></a> - I still remember the first time I tried to make these... in a friend's basement, game on, and a giant pot of hot oil on the stove. Disaster was, fortunately, averted. This recipe from Mangio da Sola looks solid and I like the addition of some grated Parmesan.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/nachos/"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Nachos</span></strong></a> - As much a collection of independent recipes combined into one as it is a dish unto itself, Nachos could be the most versatile of the finger-food-family. Simply Recipes has done a nice job of assembling the pieces for an end result that's greater than the sum of it's parts. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2009/01/stuffed-mushrooms-recipe.html"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Stuffed Mushrooms</span></strong></a> - Perhaps not as standard but you've got to get some veggies into those (couch) potatoes. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/06/salsa.html"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Salsa</span></strong></a> - Use for dipping or on top of your nachos. And save the leftovers - it'll make a good marinade for some chicken or steak.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2008/05/guacamole.html"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Guacamole</span></strong></a> - Make sure the avocados are ripe!</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.humblerecipes.com/2010/01/roasted-garlic-bean-dip.html"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Bean Dip</span></strong></a> - I like mine simple. The seven-layer kinds tend to look, well, unappetizing after the pig-skinners have been shoveling those tortilla chips through.  </li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.slashfood.com/2009/11/16/baked-jalapeno-poppers/"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Jalapeno Poppers</span></strong></a> - The folks at Slash Food have come up with a healthier twist on this usually fried fare. I specifically like the use of whole wheat flour. </li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tomato-Red-Onion-and-Basil-Bruschetta-242473"><strong><span style="font-size: 15px;">Bruschetta</span></strong></a> - Easy and fast and a good use for that aging loaf of bread. </li>
<li>Beer - Right, so, it's not a recipe. But surely this list would be incomplete without it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, enjoy the game. And save the leftovers for me.</p>
